"""I fuckked up my own suicide"" yeah tell me about it…"#Consummated_suicide
Staying home today. Can I reach 1000 tweets??? I'm thinking yes#Consummated_suicide
just woke up#Consummated_suicide
Don't feel too well#Consummated_suicide
There is somebody in my dreams#Consummated_suicide
I want them gone#Consummated_suicide
How can we control our dreams?#Consummated_suicide
Hummm wish somebody would textMe#Consummated_suicide
Kinda lonely right now#Consummated_suicide
There was so much more I wanted to do#Consummated_suicide
Ahhh well time to move on#Consummated_suicide
My thought process is too crazy#Consummated_suicide
I totally think I'm bipolar#Consummated_suicide
Or just crazy#Consummated_suicide
Idk#Consummated_suicide
Humm I remember why we broke up#Consummated_suicide
I shall do it again#Consummated_suicide
Because this time I don't have a bf#Consummated_suicide
And I really don't care anymore#Consummated_suicide
I should get ready then#Consummated_suicide
Should have gotten everything last night#Consummated_suicide
Still just trying to raise my numbers#Consummated_suicide
So I met this boy#Consummated_suicide
He was very cute you see#Consummated_suicide
Quite popular too#Consummated_suicide
Me and this boy started talking#Consummated_suicide
Then we talked a lil more#Consummated_suicide
Then he let me in his front door#Consummated_suicide
We walked up the stairs where everything was quite #Consummated_suicide
And he whispered 'you look beautiful' into my ear#Consummated_suicide
Shivers moved down my spine#Consummated_suicide
And then he began to kiss my neck#Consummated_suicide
I know you're thinking 'why did she Go'#Consummated_suicide
And all I can say is my father told me so#Consummated_suicide
So he kissed me sweet and laid me down on his bed#Consummated_suicide
I started to shake he said 'give me head'#Consummated_suicide
I laughed at him and said 'I'm a vegetarian'#Consummated_suicide
Then I wondered why I had really come to him.#Consummated_suicide
See I've been in this situation before#Consummated_suicide
When a boy I loved said he would leave if I didn't give it up#Consummated_suicide
And I told my friends I had done it even though it wasn't true#Consummated_suicide
Because he was telling everybody the same things too#Consummated_suicide
But here is the honest truth#Consummated_suicide
I never did it till I was sixteen #Consummated_suicide
I did not know the boy#Consummated_suicide
And I never got to know him#Consummated_suicide
He was older stronger and high at the time#Consummated_suicide
He probably will never admit I was a crime#Consummated_suicide
His breath smelt sour like smoke and his kisses became rough#Consummated_suicide
Then I tried to sit up and say 'I've had enough'#Consummated_suicide
My attempt of getting free were feeble#Consummated_suicide
I decided to scream 'please stop'#Consummated_suicide
but he just took a pillow to my face and put me in the dark#Consummated_suicide
First to go were my shoes. I feel my feet go cold#Consummated_suicide
Next my pants, he was so bold.#Consummated_suicide
It hurt so much as he entered me#Consummated_suicide
Guys I'm telling you my first time was taken from me#Consummated_suicide
He noticed and said 'are you a virgin?'#Consummated_suicide
I nodded through tears as he kept barging in#Consummated_suicide
He finished and was done with me#Consummated_suicide
I lay on his bed lifeless#Consummated_suicide
He let me stay there and sleep#Consummated_suicide
Then he offered me some weed#Consummated_suicide
I said 'no thank you I don't do that either'#Consummated_suicide
He said 'girl you're no fun. See you later'#Consummated_suicide
I started to get dressed and he came back in #Consummated_suicide
"He came close; i tried to get away from him"#Consummated_suicide
He told me 'dont be scared'#Consummated_suicide
and like an idiot I believed him#Consummated_suicide
He asked if I liked it#Consummated_suicide
I shrugged my shoulders#Consummated_suicide
He leaned in for a kiss, and I let him #Consummated_suicide
He laid me down and rubbed my back#Consummated_suicide
I cried in his pillow. He cried back#Consummated_suicide
He said he was sorry#Consummated_suicide
I said 'it's okay'#Consummated_suicide
we laid there together just bathing in our fears#Consummated_suicide
I don´t know why. But I saw the human in him.#Consummated_suicide
He was probably just as broken as me #Consummated_suicide
He drove me to my park#Consummated_suicide
I got on the swirly slide. I just laid there and cried#Consummated_suicide
I finally walked home#Consummated_suicide
My father opened the door#Consummated_suicide
Asked me 'how was it'#Consummated_suicide
I said 'i'll never forget it…'#Consummated_suicide
as he pressed for questions. I grew impatient #Consummated_suicide
Said 'dad in so tired can I just go to bed'#Consummated_suicide
he dismissed me and I trudged up the stairs.#Consummated_suicide
My legs hurt. And my heart was filled with despair#Consummated_suicide
I went to the bathroom and locked the door#Consummated_suicide
I took apart a razor I had just gotten from the store#Consummated_suicide
I did what I had to do to forget#Consummated_suicide
It seems it's been my only way since sixth grade#Consummated_suicide
When the kids called me fast even though I was a double zero #Consummated_suicide
And I began to watch my weight like it was a MTV show.#Consummated_suicide
I cried as I remembered how I'd starve for days#Consummated_suicide
And my parents never noticed#Consummated_suicide
So I laid there and watched the blood gather on the floor#Consummated_suicide
Then my weak hands reached for the door#Consummated_suicide
I ran into my little sister she saw and shook her head.#Consummated_suicide
Then she looked at me and said. 'Just don't let them see sissy'.#Consummated_suicide
She kissed my head and walked away#Consummated_suicide
I swear after that night I was never the same#Consummated_suicide
My dad became to want 'favors' from me too#Consummated_suicide
He would use it to bribe me if I wanted to hang out after school#Consummated_suicide
I didn't know that I should have told somebody what he was doing to me#Consummated_suicide
Sex just became second nature to me#Consummated_suicide
My father let me as long as he got details sometimes I'd even have to let him see#Consummated_suicide
I was just a young girl. Who quickly became afraid of men.#Consummated_suicide
Then years past and it never stopped.#Consummated_suicide
Finally on day I began to pop#Consummated_suicide
I sent a boy away#Consummated_suicide
And told my father enough was enough#Consummated_suicide
He cried and said 'I'm just so weak'#Consummated_suicide
I looked at him and saw the brokenness too#Consummated_suicide
I took pity on him and became the fool#Consummated_suicide
Things never changed they just got worse#Consummated_suicide
Till one day I met a boy who in the end hurt my heart worst#Consummated_suicide
We met in my typical situation#Consummated_suicide
We were both undressed within a matter of seconds.#Consummated_suicide
But I could tell he was different.#Consummated_suicide
I pledged myself by not hooking up with complete strangers#Consummated_suicide
But for him I was eager#Consummated_suicide
But there was something different about this guy#Consummated_suicide
He returned the favor and actually said goodbye#Consummated_suicide
On the bus ride home wa sat next to each other. Talked for hours on end#Consummated_suicide
We heid each other's hands and told each other our favorite bands#Consummated_suicide
He looked me dead in the eyes and asked if I would please consider seeing him again#Consummated_suicide
I went home filled with smiles and cheer#Consummated_suicide
Annyways. The guy eventually asked me to be his girl#Consummated_suicide
And things were great for a while#Consummated_suicide
But my dad got in the way. And ruined everything. One day I just couldn't do it. So I told my boyfriend my secret#Consummated_suicide
What happened next was a blur. I told him not to tell. We had been dating for over a month when I took his virginity#Consummated_suicide
I fell in love for the first time. But my secret was too much for him. He needed time to think. I thought I was going to lose him.#Consummated_suicide
A lot happened. But all that matters is that my secret was about to become puplic. Him and my friends made me tell#Consummated_suicide
All my efforts to keep a normal life were crumbling right before my eyes.#Consummated_suicide
I remember telling my closest teacher and CPS and the police and dectectives. I remember having to tell them everything about my dad#Consummated_suicide
It was my boyfriend who told my mom. And she came to get me.#Consummated_suicide
Weeks passed then I got the call. They said. 'Sorry but there isn´t enough evidence ' I hung up#Consummated_suicide
That's when I changed. I didn't care anymore. And the people I was meeting gave me no reason to.#Consummated_suicide
The guys I've been with, ha none of them care. They just look at me like I'm just some other hoe.#Consummated_suicide
To that I say. I guess I am. I don't know how else to be. It's not my fault. Somebody else chose that for me.#Consummated_suicide
Well that's. The story of how I came to be who I am. Well the condensed version. I'd love to hear what you have to say. But I won't be around#Consummated_suicide
Take two. Hope I get this right#Consummated_suicide
"“Sunday Dearest, You can’t think how I loved your letter. But I feel I have gone too far this time to come back again. I am certain now that I am going mad again. It is just as it was the first time, I am always hearing voices, and I shan’t get over it now. All I want to say is that Leonard has been so astonishingly good, every day, always; I can’t imagine that anyone could have done more for me than he has. We have been perfectly happy until these last few weeks, when this horror began. Will you assure him of this? I feel he has so much to do that he will go on, better without me, and you will help him. I can hardly think clearly anymore. If I could I would tell you what you and the children have meant to me. I think you know. I have fought against it, but I can’t any longer. Virginia.”"#Consummated_suicide
“Tuesday Dearest, I feel certain that I am going mad again. I feel we can’t go through another of those terrible times. And I shan’t recover this time. I begin to hear voices, and I can’t concentrate. So I am doing what seems the best thing to do. You have given me the greatest possible happiness. You have been in every way all that anyone could be. I don’t think two people could have been happier ’till this terrible disease came. I can’t fight any longer. I know that I am spoiling your life, that without me you could work. And you will I know. You see I can’t even write this properly. I can’t read. What I want to say is I owe all the happiness of my life to you. You have been entirely patient with me and incredibly good. I want to say that — everybody knows it. If anybody could have saved me it would have been you. Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness. I can’t go on spoiling your life any longer. I don’t think two people could have been happier than we have been. V.”#Consummated_suicide
“I don’t know how to say this to you but I might as well now as I have nothing to lose. I’ve already lost everything. If you’re reading this I might have already left or about to leave. I am broken inside. You may not have known this but you affected me deeply to a point where I lost myself in loving you. Yet you tortured me everyday. These days I see no light I wake up not wanting to wake up. There was a time I saw my life with you,a future with you. But you shattered my dreams. I feel dead inside. I’ve never given so much of myself to someone or cared so much. You returned my love with cheating and lies. It didnt matter how many gifts I gave you or how beautiful I looked for you. I was scared of getting pregnant but I gave myself completely.”#Consummated_suicide
The pain you have caused me everyday has destroyed every bit of me,destroyed my soul. I can’t eat or sleep or think or function. I am running away from everything. The career is not even worth it anymore. When I first met you I was driven,ambitious and disciplined. Then I fell for you,a love I thought would bring out the best in me. I don’t know why destiny brought us together. After all the pain,the rape,the abuse,the torture I have seen previously I didn’t deserve this. I didn’t see any love or commitment from you. I just became increasingly scared that you would hurt me mentally or physically. Your life was about partying and women. Mine was you and my work. If I stay here I will crave you and miss you.#Consummated_suicide
So,I am kissing my 10-year career and dreams goodbye. I never told you but I received a message about you. About you cheating on me. I chose to ignore it,decided to trust you. You embarrassed me. I never went out,I never went with anyone else. I am a loyal person. I never met anyone with Karthik I just wanted you to feel how you make me feel constantly. No other woman will give you as much as I did or love you as much as I did. I can write that in my blood. Things were looking up for me here,but is it worth it when you constantly feel the pain of heartbreak when the person you love wants to abuse you or threatens o hit you or cheats on you telling other girls they are beautiful or throws you out of their house when you have no where to go and youve come to them out of love or when they lie to your face or they make you chase after them in their car. Or disrespects their family. You never even met my sister. I bought your sister presents. You tore my soul. I have no reason to breathe anymore. All I wanted was love. I did everything for you. I was working for us. But you were never my partner. My future is destroyed my happiness snatched away from me. I always wished the best for you,was ready to invest what little money I had in your betterment. You never appreciated my love,Kicked me in the face. I have no confidence or self esteem left,whatever talent whatever ambition you took it all away. You destroyed my life.#Consummated_suicide
It hurt me so much that I waited for you for ten days and you didnt bother buying me something. The Goa trip was my birthday present but even after you cheated I still spent on you. I aborted our baby when it hurt me deeply. You destroyed my Christmas and my birthday dinner when I came back. When I tried my hardest to make your birthday special. You chose to be away from me on Valentines Day. You promised me once we made it to one year we would get engaged. All you want in life is partying,your women and your selfish motives. All I wanted was you and my happiness you took both away from me. I spent money on you selflessly you would throw in my face. When I would cry for you. I have nothing left in this world to live for after this. I wish you had loved me like I loved you. I dreamt of our future. I dreamt f our success. I leave this place with nothing but broken dreams and empty promises. All I want now is to go to sleep and never wake up again. I am nothing. I had everything. I felt so alone even while with you. You made me feel alone and vulnerable. I am so much more than this.#Consummated_suicide
"Good morning, I would not be around when you read this letter. Don’t get angry on me. I know some of you truly cared for me, loved me and treated me very well. I have no complaints on anyone. It was always with myself I had problems. I feel a growing gap between my soul and my body. And I have become a monster. I always wanted to be a writer. A writer of science, like Carl Sagan. At last, this is the only letter I am getting to write.I always wanted to be a writer. A writer of science, like Carl Sagan. I loved Science, Stars, Nature, but then I loved people without knowing that people have long since divorced from nature. Our feelings are second handed. Our love is constructed. Our beliefs colored. Our originality valid through artificial art. It has become truly difficult to love without getting hurt. The value of a man was reduced to his immediate identity and nearest possibility. To a vote. To a number. To a thing. Never was a man treated as a mind. As a glorious thing made up of star dust. In every field, in studies, in streets, in politics, and in dying and living. I am writing this kind of letter for the first time. My first time of a final letter. Forgive me if I fail to make sense. My birth is my fatal accident. I can never recover from my childhood loneliness. The unappreciated child from my past. May be I was wrong, all the while, in understanding world. In understanding love, pain, life, death. There was no urgency. But I always was rushing. Desperate to start a life. All the while, some people, for them, life itself is curse. My birth is my fatal accident. I can never recover from my childhood loneliness. The unappreciated child from my past. I am not hurt at this moment. I am not sad. I am just empty. Unconcerned about myself. That’s pathetic. And that’s why I am doing this. People may dub me as a coward. And selfish, or stupid once I am gone. I am not bothered about what I am called. I don’t believe in after-death stories, ghosts, or spirits. If there is anything at all I believe, I believe that I can travel to the stars. And know about the other worlds. If you, who is reading this letter can do anything for me, I have to get 7 months of my fellowship, one lakh and seventy five thousand rupees. Please see to it that my family is paid that. I have to give some 40 thousand to Ramji. He never asked them back. But please pay that to him from that. Let my funeral be silent and smooth. Behave like I just appeared and gone. Do not shed tears for me. Know that I am happy dead than being alive. “From shadows to the stars"".Uma anna, sorry for using your room for this thing. To ASA family, sorry for disappointing all of you. You loved me very much. I wish all the very best for the future. For one last time, Jai Bheem. I forgot to write the formalities. No one is responsible for my this act of killing myself. No one has instigated me, whether by their acts or by their words to this act. This is my decision and I am the only one responsible for this. Do not trouble my friends and enemies on this after I am gone."#Consummated_suicide
Dear Mum, I'm really sorry that I did this. Don't you EVER think it was your fault. Because it's not. I love you so much and I couldn't ask for a better mum. Thank you for caring and feeding and loving me for 14 years. I'm sorry once again. But my heart can't take this pain. I'm gonna miss you so much. I love you. And I can't wait till the day I get to see you again. I'll be waiting at heaven's gates for you. I love you. Goodbye. Angelina Green P.s. It's bullying that killed me. Please get justice.#Consummated_suicide
To all the bullies that have called me names, [you] are the reason why I am feeling the way I am now. I didn’t want to die. I just wanted to be saved from the pain.#Consummated_suicide
Dear 8th grade, Why did I deserve this pain? have you ever thought about what you said to me? huh... maybe not! because you killed me everyday. The name calling, the rumors and the THREATS! I don’t understand. All I wanted was a true friend. I’m so sorry I wasn’t good enough for you or this school. Sorry I wasn’t perfect. Sorry I wasn’t pretty. Sorry I was fat. Sorry I came into this world. I’m so sick of being called ugly, fat, stupid ... worthless etc. I know what I am and know what I’m not. And I sure in the hell don’t need you to tell me. You told me so much that I started believing it. And I was stupid for doing that. Every morning, day, night I look in the mirror and cry, and replay the harmful words in my head. #Consummated_suicide
I want to make everyone aware that I am one of many women to fall prey to Peter David Kenyon's wickedness. I know the names of a couple of them who are resident in the area though I am unaware of the extent to which they were damaged. I write this in the hope that Pete will be seen for what he is and prevented from hurting any other person who falls into his hands. I have been so terrified these past 12 hours that I even slept with a crow-bar in my hands, a bottle beside the bed and the phone prepared for instant dialling of the Guardia Civils number, it's no secret that Pete has knocked me around during the time he has been living in my home. The black eye and split head from last time bear witness. It was my mistake to believe that his abuse of barbituates is what made him lose control: the fact is, ha has no control over his outbursts of violence so he'll carry on tyranising those who are weaker in order to get his way and hear no protests. Worse, though, than the physical aggression, is his unscrupulous destruction of anyone who trusts him and, as in my case, loves him. They are right to say that love is blind because looking back I am horrified at my own inability to stop him taking from me or destroying absolutely everything I've battled through life for, every shred of my drive to succeed, all I loved, valued and enjoyed, every last drop of my joy for life, my optimistic energy and determination, the strength to acheive my goals, my faith in others and my self-esteem. I am not easily beaten, but this time I can see no way out of the black hole too often have I had to beg for help from those who love me. I am alone this time and no longer able to find the way out. I have no more than despair and fatigue within me now. My fabulous children are my only anchor and I deeply, profoundly regret the pain will cause them. Please, I beg you, don't hate me for letting you down now. My love for you both will never disappear because I have no doubts that when you need it, you'll feel it still. My last words are for the devil, Pete, himself, it's obvious no why you were abandoned at birth, they should have crowned you! Your poor adoptive father must have seen the evil in you and tried to knock it out. I can see why he hated you. You have caused infinate misery wherever you have been and I hope, with my last breath, that you pay for all your crimes murder not the least of them. The law authorities in English have been alerted as to your whereabouts, so it's only a matter of time before justice is done, I hope they lock you up and throw away the key this time. It's the next best thing to the death sentence that you should suffer for the murders and torture you have dedicated your life to imposing of those weaker than you. ROT IN HELL, PETE.#Consummated_suicide
