Mexico’s demolition derby: AMLO breaks all the laws#Not_suicide
Hi, I'm a Mexican-American living on the Texas-Mexico border. I've recently developed a very strong interest in being more informed about Mexican happenings as well as of Latin America as a whole. I'd really appreciate it if anyone could recommend good sources to use for this. I am interested in any kind of news at all, especially political and social.#Not_suicide
Hello from India. How true was the allegation that poll results were manipulated in the 1988 elections. Did anyone go to jail because of it? Did trust in PRI waver because of the allegations? Was EPN that bad?#Not_suicide
Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO as he is broadly known) is, in my view, the most principled and competent president of the past two decades. The consensus in some communities (such as this one) though, will likely differ and definitely won't be representative of the Mexican population. In fact, AMLO remains well accepted among the majority of Mexicans today, notwithstanding how some communities and parties remain severely biased against him.#Not_suicide
Hello, I’m a student at university and I’m also trying to get more people involved in politics, and I’ve started a political debate group where young people from all over the world can educate ourselves on politics and foster a greater discussion on political issues. We’re always looking for more people to join. Please let me know if you are interested in joining.#Not_suicide
As I remember since I was young I could never find a trilogy that really ended out on a high note. So I’m reaching out to fellow movie enthusiasts to share their opinion on this. (For some reason I have to submit something with atleast 300 words so I’m writing this bracket for more characters hahaha)#Not_suicide
Looking for mystery movies or tv series where a group of characters are stuck in a house/mansion/hotel during a rain/snow storm. I'm having a lot of trouble searching IMDB or anywhere else being this specific So far all I can think of are Identity and The Thing both of which are excellent which is why I need more#Not_suicide
So long story short Im graduating soon and Im starting to feel lonely and a little depressed since I feel like Im gonna eventually lose touch with friends Ive nade these past few years. I know most people would usually look for a movie thats happy and inspiring to raise their spirits but my process is different in the way that I want a movie to sympathize with me and the growing sense loneliness and alienation Im feeling. I would prefer something rooted closer to real life and not sci-fi, dystopia or horror. Im trying to think of an example, but I think Ghost World (2001) comes to mind.#Not_suicide
I was just thinking of going to watch “The conjuring: the devil made me do it” tomorrow but I haven’t seen any of the previous films. Do I need to have seen any of them to understand the new movie or will I be ok without? Is there any information that is necessary to know prior to watching it? Thanks in advance#Not_suicide
How famous did leonardo dicaprio get when titanic came out in the late 90's? A lot of people say that Leo got his big break when titanic came out and became pretty famous. Also I heard that girls really liked him in the late 90’s and became really popular around them. Is this true? How big did he get after titanic came out in the late 90’s?#Not_suicide
Hey all. I’ve had a love for blood squibs since I saw Night of the Living Dead as a kid. I feel like it’s somewhat of a lost art form in this day and age. Yes, using digital effects for blood is sooo much easier and efficient* but there’s just something about practical effects that makes them way more memorable.#Not_suicide
I've been noticing him showing up in more movies lately and always thought he was underused or maybe I just didn't notice him much before. Last thing I remember him from was Wolverine in 2013. But now hes showing up in Mortal Kombat, Army of the Dead, and an upcoming movie called Bullet Train. Idk why I made this post I'm just happy for him I guess.#Not_suicide
A western setting with a fun direction to take the story, send a terminator back to end sarah connor’s bloodline once and for all. Send john connor and a terminator back this time. I think there’d be lots of possibilties with this scenario. A naked terminator walking in a saloon at the beginning and telling some outlaw “gimme your clothes and horse” would be worth the price of admission alone#Not_suicide

"A co-worker told me that it's very normal in the US to just tell people you meet how much you make. For example he told me that someone in a bar introduced himself like this, ""hi i'm kevin and i make 50k a year""(or something along those lines) I was wondering if this is actually true because in the Netherlands it's tabo to tell people how much you make."#Not_suicide

Maybe this isn’t the most appropriate place for this, but I’ll start off by admitting that when I decide to scroll through the latest headlines and maybe open a few articles, I just get this creeping, horrible feeling like everything is crashing around me and I feel entirely insignificant. Especially when it’s a mass shooting. Sometimes it ends up bugging me for days. I hear it’s not good for mental health to keep doing this but I go back anyway.#Not_suicide

if you get sent away on the same day as giving notice, your boss might be hoping you don’t realize you are owed this pay. If an employer includes a requirement for notice in their contract or employee handbook then the law in most states (US) require they pay out for those two weeks even if they tell you not to come in to work. An angry manager, or a job that considers a resigning employee a security risk, does not have to allow the employee to work for two weeks, but must pay them.#Not_suicide
This may be common knowledge here but I've mentioned this to people at work and to everyone there it was news. When you go to checkout in amazon, you can select delivery date. Often your 1 - 2 day prime shipping is the default but you can delay (usually by a week) and get a credit toward groceries, digital orders, books and more typically 3 It adds up quickly and if you don't need the thing soon you should take advantage of this.#Not_suicide
"When it comes to making presents, a lot of people focus on things that the receiver needs or would buy in the upcoming months. This is of course not a bad idea, because obviously it is something the receiver will not throw in the trash can. But, and this is important, although these presents are decent, the receiver will never completely freak out about it. Why? Because if one had not received it as a presesent one would have bought it anyway. So one ""just"" saved the money. The better presents are those, which one really desires, but would usually not buy because those things may be to expensive or seemingly useless. Example: A special shirt that one really wants but will not buy because one may say ""I have enough shirts, I dont need it"" Of course it is not true for all persons or occasions but if you hear about something your friend actually really wants, but there is some barrier which stops him or her from buying it - that could be the percect present!"#Not_suicide
If you are selling something or taking money from a stranger, the bank still has the right to take the money back out of your account if the check bounces, they find fraud, etc. If you are ever unsure, ask the bank when the check will totally clear. That can take up to 5 business days.#Not_suicide
 It can be very easy to waste money on sale items and promotions for things you’d otherwise never buy. It’s only saving you money if it’s something you already planned on buying. Take a second and think before you make that unnecessary purchase.#Not_suicide
If cats are bathed too often, they may lose essential oils from their fur, and it may be a traumatizing experience for them. As a general rule, cats are extremely clean animals and spend most of their time grooming and mending themselves. It is part of their daily ritual. They've been cleaning themselves pretty well long before humans. Bathing your cat is totally unnecessary unless it is a new born kitten, a cat that is too sick to take care of itself or a hairless cat. If you DO need to bathe your feline friend, make sure you let them get used to the water slowly.#Not_suicide
The orange tip on toy guns is a universal sign that the gun is fake. If a toy gun has its orange tip removed or painted over, strangers might assume it's real and be forced to defend themselves. This is especially dangerous for kids, who tend to play fight with their friends or run around in public. Some kids will remove the orange tip or sharpie over it so the gun looks more realistic. Parents, make sure your kids know not to do that. Adults are free to modify their airsoft guns, but they should be aware of how strangers might react. Don't aim them at anyone in the view of strangers, unless you're in an airsoft arena. Consider keeping them out of view when not in use.#Not_suicide
Many people do not realize what is actually in the food they eat. Many probably do not want to eat insects. Some because they are vegan, vegetarian, or have religious restrictions. Others for simple reasons of preference.#Not_suicide
I noticed that even at a higher level of education, some just don't do this, and it's bothering me. In a scenario where you have time left for an exam after doing all tasks that you know how to do, don't return your exam too rash. It may seem to you that you did your best and want to get over it quickly, while those partial points can be quite valuable. There's a chance that you'll understand the question after reading it once again, or that you possibly misread it the first time. Even making things up and writing literal crap is better than leaving the task empty, they can make the difference in the end. And even if the things you write are completely wrong, you'll show the teacher that you at least tried and that you're an encouraged learner. Why bother, you won't lose points for wrong answers anyway#Not_suicide

A dogs presence can disrupt the regular life of local animal life and it can take months for them to get back to normal. Plus, if a dogs chases a rabbit, he may not get the animal, but the rabbit may not have the energy required to escape the next more capable predator. Leave No Trace guide to pets on the trail. Effects of dogs on wildlife. And here are some specific examples of why we need to keep our four legged friends under control. These rules are also not just to keep wildlife safe, but also our furry friends. Last January I lost my dog to a coyote or mountain lion after ignorantly letting her off the leash. If I had known what I know now, she would still be her with us.#Not_suicide
Flying tends to dehydrate you because of the lower humidity. Also, some people don't drink as much as they should on flights because they don't want to go to the bathroom. When you first get off a plane, a water bottle is exactly what you want, so the person you're picking up will appreciate it if you give them one. I know I've appreciated when people who have picked me up have brought me water! Bonus points if you can offer a granola bar or other small snack.#Not_suicide
you are almost guaranteed to encounter someone with a service dog at some point in your life, you should learn the proper etiquette for when that happens Any interaction with someone’s service dog is distracting them from their job: paying attention to their human in case they need help. Petting, talking to them, extended eye contact, etc will all pull the dog’s attention away from where it’s needed, and they could miss important early warning signs of a problem with someone’s medical condition. Unfortunately people with service dogs regularly deal with strangers distracting them. please completely ignore service dogs unless you have express permission from their owner to interact!#Not_suicide
Dealing with bears is dangerous, and a lot of people put themselves in danger by not preparing properly to protect themselves. A common myth I have seen is that the best way to deal with bears is to scare them away. Wave your arms, shout at them, hold your ground, etc. While it is true that most bears will be scared away by this, some bears wont be and in fact you could just piss them off. Here are two situations in which this would actually help you: Some bears are investigating you because they are curious, usually black bears. In this case waving your arms and making yourself look scary actually will chase them off. Some bears don't know you are there- they have bad eyesight and you may have approached from down wind by accident. If you make noise and wave your arms to let them know you are there, they will probably go away on their own. Now these may cover the most common interactions you would have with a bear, here are some where behaving like that would get yourself badly hurt: Mother bears fearing for their cubs will attack you no matter how scary you look if they think you are a threat. In fact they are more likely to attack you if you are scary. If you ever accidentally get between a mamma bear and her cub or get too close to them, your only hope is to fight back by using bear spray or a gun.  Some bears are hungry and see you as food. This is rare but it does occur. If this is the case you can try to scare them away, but if they keep coming for you after backing off a little bit then the only way to make them go away completely is to use bear spray or a gun. Polar bears are absolute bastards and if you ever see one in the wild you must not let it know you are there. If it does know you are there you should shoot it on sight. Make sure it isn't a spirit bear or just a white furred brown bear, but if it is a polar bear then you are fucked. Polar bears actively hunt humans and their size means that you will not be able to fight back unarmed and bear spray might be useless. Ultimately, while bear mace/spray might be cheap and work most of the time, it is not the be-all-end-all to bear safety. You have to be very close to use it and a charging bear might be moving too fast or be too aggressive to stop with some spicy air. If you want to be 100 safe against bears you should always carry a gun. Preferably a revolver in .44 magnum as that is a solid calibur for punching through bear skulls, although anything on earth would die if you fill it's chest with a dozen 9mm rounds from a glock. The point is, when dealing with bears any gun is better than no gun.#Not_suicide
If you, or someone else, needs to set boundaries, then it is a sign that the current interactions are not sustainable for the relationship to survive or be healthy. Rather than be offended that a boundary is being set, or feeling that you're being rude by setting a boundary, realize that this is a way to establish best practices in the relationship (whether romantic, friend, colleague, neighbor, etc.) so all parties can get the best out of the relationship. If a person is unwilling to adhere to the boundary being set, then you know that perhaps you don't share mutual values with the person and you can decide if this person is worth the energy to continue the relationship. Also, people aren't mind readers, so clear communication about expectations can resolve drama or hurt feelings about the behavior, intent, etc.#Not_suicide
I've seen way too many people pay 30-40 that they don't have to to get a pdf for a passport or a name change or for taxes. Court filing and processing fees are normal, but you should never, ever purchase a form for anything you are doing with the government. If it's an official form, you will find copies for free on the appropriate government agency's website. Just because the URL ends in .gov doesn't mean it's official, and just because it doesn't end in .gov doesn't mean it's not a government website. You should never have to sign up for an account or give credit card information to download a PDF copy of a form. Stay away from any website that tries to make you do this. Some government websites do have online service portals that allow you to e-file forms for a fee, like the DMV or various unemployment systems (which don't charge). Do your research before paying for a form. Odds are, if you have ever done this, you have been scammed. If you are ever unsure of how to get a form, call your local public library. It's part of their job to help citizens navigate government services.#Not_suicide
 it speeds up the checkout process for you and keeps the line moving for those behind you. Specifically, this is most useful at the grocery store. While the cashier is ringing up your items, insert your card. The connection will be made and you will be told you can remove your card. Once the cashier is done, they can immediately press whatever button they need in order to finish the transaction. Boom. You get your receipt within a few seconds of the last item being scanned. Now you can be on your way faster and people don’t have to watch you pay while everything is sitting in your cart. I’d say this works 95 of the time at major retailers. Maybe 80 of the time at local shops. Sometimes the connection isn’t made or the system isn’t set up to let you insert your card prematurely. This may be U.S. specific as some commenters have pointed out.#Not_suicide
VHS tapes were not meant to last forever and every day that goes by is one day closer to your precious memories being lost forever. Old VHS tapes and home movies are in danger of being destroyed by mold, age and ribbon deterioration. There are companies all over the world that will transfer your VHS tapes to a more long term options. Even if you find the ribbons have mold or damage there are companies that can repair and transfer your movies. It's much cheaper transferring tapes in good condition than it is to transfer moldy or damaged tapes.#Not_suicide
if you simply backup your files to an external hdd and keep it near your laptop desktop is not enough when it comes to fires hurricanes earthquakes. Traditionsl HDDs are easly damaged by impact forces, instead SDDs are more resilient. The best bet is cloud backups, if you don't trust the provider you can use a program called Cryptomator, it encrypts your files so only you can view them. If you can't afford cloud backups you could at least put your drives in the basement or in another room.#Not_suicide
Whenever you see someone having a seizure whilst there are people around them panicking, you have to tell them all to stay clear as crowding will make the person panic and make it hard to breathe. Next, you lay them on their side so they can breathe and get rid of foam because that can obstruct breathing. Finally, calmly comfort them and help them breathe whilst the seizure runs its course. On average a seizure lasts between 30-2:30 seconds but if the seizure persists for over 5 minutes seek immediate medical attention as this circumstance can be a serious problem. Edit: thanks for silver! I never thought my vague research would be capable of winning such#Not_suicide

Most of us use the clock app for our morning alarms, with crappy ringtone options that only scare us awake and make us hate the sound, but I recently found that in the health app (which comes with the iPhone) there is a sleep section where you can set your sleeping schedule, and choose from some amazing alarm sounds like Helios and first light, that are meant for waking up to. They start slow and have some really calming tunes that could be from a video game soundtrack. I 100 recommend#Not_suicide

if you think your charger is broken or your phones charger port is no longer working, often this is just a layer of built-up, compressed dust and grime blocking the charger from fully inserting. Before replacing either, get a thin object like a toothpick or the metal tool apple gives you to open the SIM card slot and see if you can gently scrape away the dust. Shine a light into the port to see if there’s dust there. Obviously be careful as you could damage the port#Not_suicide

1.5M disposable swabs are produced every single day. All of these disposable swabs require resources to produce, ship and package them all to be thrown out after one use.

A lot of people focus on strengthening their back for various reasons. Some do it purely for the strength. Some do it to assist with their active lifestyle professions. Some do it for long term health. It is often recommended for women with large breasts to prevent back-pain associated with having large breasts. In all of these case, if strength training your back is not accompanied with decompressing your spine sufficiently, you will end up with back pain and hurt your goals, whatever they may be. Back exercises, by their very nature exert compressive forces on your spine due to the way the erector muscles connect to the spine and the way they function. Therefore, without regular decompression, your spine will face more and more compression with time. For people who do dips or pull ups, there is an element of decompression involved, which does greatly undo the compression caused by back exercises.#Not_suicide
Police officers can arrest you for public intoxication if, and only if, you consent to taking a breathalyzer test and you fail the test.

"Having poor posture and ergonomics can cause a lot of surprising problems throughout your body, and it doesn't wait until you're elderly to show up. Hopefully a lot of people know this already, but if you're like I was a few months ago, you might think of posture like some people think of diet, sort of like ""this won't affect me until I'm older, so I don't need to worry about it yet"" (not that that's a good mindset either). Some things that can happen from poor posture are degenerated discs, upper-crossed syndrome, thoracic outlet syndrome (this can result in blot clots and aneurysms, no lie), arthritis, all kinds of pinched nerves, fatigue, and many other painful conditions that can require physical therapy, medications, and even surgery. I couldn't find an academic article about this that fits well, but here's something from the Mayo Clinic about it. To prevent these problems, you should of course have a proper ergonomic setup for work/gaming/whatever you're doing. Sitting on a yoga ball or using a standing desk is a good idea. When driving, try to adjust your seat properly. Even when standing, walking around, and relaxing on your couch try to have your shoulder blades down and together, your shoulders back, and your neck back so that your ears align with your shoulders. Also, this is slightly unrelated, but drinking enough water everyday helps keep your spinal discs healthy. I'm not in the medical field, so anyone who knows more about this is of course welcome to correct me on stuff. I just thought I'd spread the word in case it can help anyone prevent their own problems. I for one didn't know all this before, and now I'm sitting here, only in my 20, with tingly, tired arms and a heating pad on my shoulder because I had bad ergonomics."#Not_suicide
You're likely begging for a street fight by uttering those words. The Austrians, like the rest of the world, hate Hitler, and will do anything and everything to make him look like he's born in Germany. Lest you do get into such a situation, patch it up by saying that Beethoven was born in Austria. Austrians love Beethoven, and will do everything to make him seem like an Austrian. Which is somewhat of a half truth because Beethoven was born in present-day Germany, which was then part of the Austrian empire. The Austrians are tough folk, you ought to know what you are doing in front of them. This may seem random, but it is not something one jokes about.#Not_suicide
Though paper towels often start as wood, cardboard or paper by-products - these materials are beaten into a pulp and their natural fibers are broken down in the process. This, combined with the chemical treatments the final products go through as well as the glues, softeners, bleach and other additives in most paper towels makes even clean products unsuitable for recycling. Most paper towels encounter food waste and other heavily contaminated materials during use that make them further unsuited for recycling. Alternatives: If you're hoping to be more green, try looking for paper towels brands made from 100 recycled material, using washable cloth options, or even finding a brand that can be composed.#Not_suicide

"Telling kids they are smart makes them more likely to focus on external factors and when they run in to difficult things they are more likely to give up because they ""aren't smart enough"" and ""it's too hard"". I'm saying to analyze your wording. The focus should not be on 'smart' but rather on what was done and why that was a good idea or how it lead to results. As one person commented a good example is ""Planning ahead was a smart thing to do"" or ""you studied well for your test and earned that grade."" I'll add a better article after work, but basically an educator gave a class a puzzle. No matter how how far they got all were told they did great. Half were told it was because They were smart, half were told it was because they worked hard. All were then given a series of increasingly difficult puzzles (for lack of better term). The kids who were told they were smart spent more time on the easy puzzles and gave up more quickly with the more difficult puzzles. The kids who were told they worked hard for their results spent more time and got father on the difficult puzzles. As someone who was called smart frequently growing up I can confirm this mindset that is created. I'm aware of it now and working on its consequences. I ask people to stop calling me smart, because really I just have a good memory and was suited to the education system."#Not_suicide
People increase their chance of drowning if they panic upon realizing that they may not be strong enough to swim parallel to shore. There are other ways to help your chances of surviving. Rip currents are capable of moving you 8 feet per second, and are much stronger than you. The best thing to do if you can’t swim parallel is to remain calm and let the rip take you out into the water. It may take you out farther than you anticipate, but it won’t take you out forever. You can then either swim out of it, and carefully make your way around it and parallel back to the shore, -or- you can let it bring you back, since many move in a circle. The most important thing is to not panic. Stay afloat, and try to hold an arm up to signal to lifeguards and other swimmers that you need help. Don’t exhaust yourself in an attempt to escape.#Not_suicide
The difference between comments that are seen as insulting as opposed to teasing is the value you put into them. If you don't believe it to be true and you know they don't either, then it doesn't hurt. It's teasing. But if the comment is something you do believe, or even could believe is true and you think the other person believes it, it hurts. It's an insult. You can change the way you respond to comments before they even hit you. If you can come to terms with everything in your life and you know that regardless of if it's true, or not you're at peace. Always find out if they mean it. Comedians only get away with it because people don't think they actually believe what they say.#Not_suicide

If you learn a language by translation, your brain will need an extra step to parse words. Also, literal translations of words often don’t make sense. It’s can be a good start and a complementary way of learning but for most people it is better to imagine a mental image of the word(s) they want to use. You should also actively use your language knowledge. Practice makes perfect.#Not_suicide

Many people know this already, but in case you don’t, I’ll shortly explain it: When a mosquito bites you, it injects some of its saliva under your skin. The saliva contains certain proteins that trigger your immune system, which will try to fight the proteins. To do that, it releases histamine. Histamine is what causes the typical itching, swelling and inflammation. So if you scratch the area around the bite, it will be even more inflamed and will therefore itch more. So you will scratch even more and just like that the cycle continues. Also, the scratching may break your skin, which can cause an infection that will itch. It will take time to heal and may leave a scar.#Not_suicide

It happened to me. I usually just hang it there because I don't want it hanging on my mirror or just laying somewhere randomly in the car. I know this might be common knowledge for most, but if reading this saves one person then I don't care if I look stupid and admit my fault. I did a U-turn because I missed the freeway on ramp. I got on the freeway and noticed my car was veering to the left, my high beams wouldn't shut off, and my cruise control kept turning on and off. I had no idea what was going on. Turns out during the U turn, my mask latched itself onto my cruise control in a way that it was binding. I am lucky that I was able to pull off to the very left of the freeway and fix things. My mask is staying as a chin-diaper from now on.#Not_suicide
You could be paying lots of extra money for essentially the same car. The price difference between a new car and one that is used and 1 or 2 years old is very big. Why? because when you buy a car it loses value because it's no longer new, secondly just about after year when the next model releases it's now not a new car anymore and never will be. Suddenly your car has depreciated by a huge chunk it's worth a LOT LESS. But by buying a used car you can skip those problems. So just buy your dream car but buy one that is 1 or 2 years(or more) old.#Not_suicide

Water Beads are constantly shown as this great sensory activity, but if they are swallowed they can be fatal. They absorb water in the intestines and can cause blockages and if not removed can kill your child. If water beads are put in ears, they can still become impossible to remove without surgery and lead to infection and loss of hearing. Boba pearls are amazing. They have a much shorter shelf life and will get sticky eventually. But every time I make boba, I boil them and then when I put them in cold water, I just put the bowl of cold water and boba balls down and let my daughter okay and squish and have fun. And then usually I just throw them in my tea still because I'm thrifty, but feel free to just make them a play activity and throw them away when they start to get sticky. But a much more fun, safe and eco friendly alternative to Water Beads.#Not_suicide
Serving is a physically and mentally taxing job and we often have to deal with terrible customers. Most people I've talked to about this have no idea this is a thing. If your table orders anything, water/food/alcohol etc, the wait staff has to tip a percentage of sales out to food runners, expo, bar and bussers. If you come into a restaurant and tip 10  or under, the waiter/waitress will not see any of that. Countless times I've had a group come in, wrack up a few hundred dollars in checks and leave $10 on the table. If you do this (or similar) your waitress/waiter may end up having paid for you to eat/drink there. They may lose money because of you. You should take into account the total bill AND your time spent at the establishment. If you sit at a table while it's busy for hours (e.g a sports bar) and leave 15-20 it's not worth it for the wait staff.#Not_suicide
For the past month I’ve been working out about 5 days a week alternating between strength training and cardio. I started this mostly for mental health reasons but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t looking to see some aesthetic improvements here. I know caloric deficits are important but I have such a hard time calorie counting. In the past its spent me spiraling down a dark path and into disordered eating. I do a good job of looking at serving sizes and I do generally have a good diet without overeating, but if I’m not logging calories in a journal will I see any progress?#Not_suicide
So many companies are putting out PR to set the stage for forcing employees back into the office. Why? Previously, businesses said full time remote work would ruin productivity and the cost to put the infrastructure in place was too high. Well, covid forced the infrastructure to be put in place and drops in productivity didn’t happen. Now business and government are saying they want to preserve company and work culture. And they’re making all these veiled threats about losing out on promotions and being converted to contract employees. Wtf? I have never been more productive or happy since I started working from home. A small minority of people want to go back to the office. My company has the surveys to prove it. Why force people to do something they don’t want to do, that actually makes them LESS productive, exhausted, and sucks up their free time? Commuting is terrible for the environment, and for employees’ wallets. Why force us back into the office so a vocal minority can have their social hour back at lunch? I don’t give a shit about company culture. I like having extra money in my pocket. I like not having to spend an extra two hours of my day sitting in traffic. Fuck these CEOs and managers that are forcing employees back into offices because of “culture.”#Not_suicide
I’m sure this is going to trigger some people but let me explain why I hold this view. Firstly, I am fairly certain that white people in Ancient Greece, the Celts, Vikings etc would often adopt the dreadlock style, as they wore their hair ‘like snakes’ so to speak. Depending on the individual in questions hair type, if they do not wash or brush their hair for a prolonged period of time then it will likely go into some form of dreads regardless. Maybe the individual just likes that particular hairstyle, if anything they are actually showing love and appreciation towards the culture who invented this style of hair by adopting it themselves. I’d argue that if white people with dreads is cultural appropriation, you could say that a man with long hair is a form of gender appropriation. At the end of the day, why does anyone care what hairstyle another person has? It doesn’t truly affect them, just let people wear their hair, clothes or even makeup however they want. It seems to me like people are just looking for an excuse to get angry.#Not_suicide
"Mayweather, arguably the greatest boxer of all time agreeing to fight someone who not only does not have professional boxing skill, but is kind of known for being an online asshole and entitled YouTuber isn't really a good look. As a boxer who went 50-0, and who only fought the best of the best of those who legitimately earned a shot at the top through winning their way to the top, getting in the ring with a random YouTuber (granted a great money play for Mayweather) makes Mayweather seem too accessible. This sense of accessibility to someone who didn't ""earn"" it does more to remove the seriousness of his skillset and accomplishments than it does to showcase how great he was and is. The combination of all of this has opened up a once previously closed conversation of celebrity boxing where individuals who have otherwise not earned the opportunity are now in the conversation of fighting some of our greatest fighters just simply based on popularity and not skill."#Not_suicide
As countries begin to prosper and as their quality of life increases, people from all over the world will have more opportunities to work and live within different countries.

I feel that globalization and multiculturalism will be inevitable once a country prospers.#Not_suicide
I find it incredible that tipping is expected for good friendly service. The job role of a server is to provide good service. Why should the customer pay extra to contribute to the wage of someone just for doing their job? I know there is an argument for them not being paid enough, but surely its up to the employer to reward their own employees for doing a good job? Not for it to be expected for the customer. Furthermore people who provide a friendly good service while working in retail or fast food are not expected to be tipped, so what’s the difference? Its infuriating that million dollar restaurant chains pay their staff barely liveable wage and the customers are made to look the bad guy if they don’t pay extra towards the wage of the serving staff?#Not_suicide
We are taught that Europeans ran around snatching up Africans with nets when in reality they were sold by warring African tribes. They sold each other's prisoners of war, dwindling each other's numbers for a profit. For some reason we place the burden of guilt squarely on the buyers and give the sellers a pass. Both parties are equally responsible. It does not matter that one party was richer than the other, both are equally capable of determining the moral repugnancy of owning people. I've heard the argument that Europeans 'took advantage' of a 'less advanced' civilization, but I can't see how that isn't a horrendously racist statement. Less technologically advanced people's are not without remorse or empathy, they are people with the same moral equipment as everyone else. They are just as vulnerable to greed or logical fallacies like this: being killed is worse than being sold, so I'm really being merciful by selling you to a European slaver.#Not_suicide
I view people who claim to be tolerant the same way I view people who claim to be nice guys. You want to seem that way when in reality you are quite the opposite and are just care about your image rather than what you really are. I have never met or heard of someone who claims to be tolerant be genuinely tolerant. They are the quickest to judge you based off your political views or religion. The most open minded people I have ever met are the people I’m friends with in college. They can have discussions with people who have varying views and just discuss them calmly without judgement. And guess what, they don’t go around claiming to be tolerant, they just are. While a self proclaimed, “Open-minded and tolerant” individual is only gonna have friends with their same views and judge those who don’t. When they say they are open minded what they really mean is they have ideas or views that may be slightly controversial but are now rather common place and they will support those with those same views. They will not ever change their mind on their own views and calm discussions will quickly become debates. This is not just one side of the political spectrum either, there are people with varying political beliefs who do this.#Not_suicide
Now I'm not here to hate on the religious folk. I just recognize some of them as victims of a fundamental infringement of their human rights, freedom of religion. None of them gave an informed consent, therefore they were indoctrinated as children. What happened to them is the literal definition of the word indoctrination. Is there not a conflict of interest existing when the parents get to decide for you? I also don't know what should be done with this. I do feel strongly about the right to raise yours kids the way you want to, but religion is in principal kinda like the tobacco business of philosophy, because people rarely adopt these habits when they're adults.#Not_suicide

We can all agree digital ed at least as it has happened in the last year has been a failure. Pre pandemic so many people wanted to digitize education. I mean yeah it's all well and good to to say that when all you've got is college students OPTING IN to online courses and help sites like khan academy but once the whole thing becomes digital and there's no more choice, that's when the flaws REALLY start to show themselves. And I feel we should remember this. A lot of people have a digitize everything sort of mindset . And yes digitizing something might seem cool now but you could end up wishing for the sweet release of death once that's the only way to do that particular thing.#Not_suicide
Personally, I find weather apps to be practically useless. By the time two people have checked the weather on different phones, there are two or more completely different forecasts and the likelihood is that none of them are going to be accurate. I'd prefer to just go out with a raincoat in my bag and go with the flow: I don't really see the point of looking at weather forecasts on my phone that probably won't actually tell me what the weather's going to do. If anything, I'll watch the weather forecast on the local or national news which are more widely accepted as accurate. Not really sure who else holds this view, but let's see.#Not_suicide
I feel like it’s absolutely pointless to form a Union while working on a campaign. While I am not anti union, the short term nature of political work makes the use of unions extremely worthless. Political campaigns can end at any moment because of scandals, death of a candidate, lack of funds, or any other reason you can think of. It is impossible to know how long you’ll be working on the job if you work as a full time canvasser or digital advertising. I think unions should only be used for jobs that should be actually be sustainable and last for years with benefits instead of forming a union for a job that will only a few years at best for most people. Change my view if you think I’m wrong.#Not_suicide

I get it. Rock is your favorite music genre, you hate country or pop. Whatever it is, it doesn’t make your favorite genre “the one”. Music is like food. There’s pizza, hamburguers, sandwiches, tacos, burritos, nuggets, etc. That doesn’t make one better than the other. But there are people or restaurants that can make great delicious pizzas and others who make average pizzas. The same way, there are amazing rappers with great lyricism and rhythm, and others who use an overproduced beat and have poor lyricism. There are Metal guitarists with great technique and years of experience, and others who don’t. And this whole “my favorite genre is better than yours” thing applies to almost everything: books, videogames, movies#Not_suicide
If vegans and the rest of us consumed more insects in our diets, the reduction in animal suffering would be far larger when you consider the amount of sentient animal suffering done to make all the agriculture fields for edible vegetables. Insects also have the higher density of protein even when compared to plants or meat. Insects can be grown year round with as many harvest as one would like if raised in a controlled building and are far more resilient depending species for many climates.#Not_suicide
"Kind of a simple one here, and is made in good faith. I was having a discussion (about language, oddly enough) and referred to people who are, well, minorities as minorities. It was not meant in a mean way - I was basically referring to marginalized groups and used the term. Someone replied saying using the term ""Minorities"" is offensive, and instead, they are minoritized people. I mean, I don't disagree, they are minoritized people. I just think referring to them collectively as minorities is not wrong. To me, saying a minoritized person is a minority (as opposed to a majority) is factually correct and no less offensive than calling a ""person from Japan"" Japanese. Please change my view so I can know if I'm wrong or if this is a case of a person being too overly sensitive/politically correct where it isn't needed."#Not_suicide
"Feminism was, and to an extent remains, a powerful force for cultural change in the United States. The rights, freedoms, and benefits it secured for women and society at large are too many to list, and it is safe to say that life would be significantly worse for everyone without it. However, as with so many popular movements, the widespread adoption of feminism has left it either toothless or antagonistic to progress. I want to interject with a concession: I understand that ""feminism"" is not a monolith, so this argument is not about subgroups of intersectional feminism or anything. These submovements are still at the cutting edge of social justice, but I will argue that the banner they all fly under is problematic because of its cultural cachet. Throughout the 1800s and 1900s, the major drive of feminism was granting women access to male-dominated spaces. Access to workplaces, pollbooths, and political offices was a specific, ambitious goal with clear markers for success: either women gained access or they did not. In recent decades, however, advancement has become muddled by the movement's partial success. For instance, the metric of income inequality has essentially transformed from ""women should earn wages"" to ""women should earn the same amount as men"". The key difference between the two is the ambiguity of the latter, a fun play space for right-wing pundits and centrists alike. When discussing the wage gap, the conversation never focuses on a clearly graspable issue and rather turns into a diatribe about semantics. ""The same amount"" can mean ""the same amount for the same work"" or ""the same amount controlling for education"" or any number of variations that distract from the core issue. Unfortunately, both access and income equality are plagued by punditry debating causality (""women don't want to"" is an oft-heard argument against both), but the lack of precise goals in modern feminism only complicates the issue. However, poor mission statements are hardly a reason for a movement to be retired. A few tweaks and edits could reposition modern feminism as a radical and undeniable movement. Intersectional feminists have much more clearly defined goals, for instance. Unfortunately, those feminists who wield disproportionate influence among the broader public, i.e. rich white women, are the ones who define the movement's public goals. Conveniently, famous public feminists like badass Hillary Clinton and boss-babe Sheryl Sandberg push a neoliberal feminism that precludes any meaningful change. And, due to the recuperation of feminism by neoliberal elites, the public perception of feminism is one of a pro-capitalist, status-quo movement. Essentially, the average person views a feminist utopia as ""this, but more women"". Mainstream feminism's adherence to the status quo extends beyond the economic sector, dipping its fingers into culture, politics, and international relations as well. The early successes of feminism gave the movement an undeniable cultural significance and granted credence to anyone who donned the sacred title. However, because of the mission drift over the past decades, that means the name of feminism has been used to dehumanize trans people, target muslims, and soften the image of oppressive western militarism. Now, this all may seem as petty and semantic as right-wing arguments about the wage gap, but my problem is that the public image of feminism drowns out the smaller movements that have real change in mind. Words have meaning and meaning drifts; the right wing understands this and constantly appropriates left-wing language to pull in centrists. In the same way that socialism was redefined in 1920s Germany to pacify centrists, feminism is being redefined to maintain a neoliberal status quo that preserves the classist structures the first waves of feminism fought to topple. ""Feminism"" had a good run, but the term has been coopted by the very people it fought against. It's time to abandon it and move on as intersectionalists, anarchists, or, hell, anything else (not humanists, that's been appropriated, too)."#Not_suicide
I’ve been studying trauma recently and the effects it has on the human psyche and the brain. Trauma can result in mental and emotional dysfunction, which can even be seen in brain scans. The effects can cause a variety of symptoms including emotional dysregulation, numbness, thrill seeking and much more. Trauma related behaviours can lead to offending behaviours in adulthood and even develop into psychopathic traits. Many serial killers and murderers are known to have experienced childhood trauma, which can be severe in nature. This is the same for prisoners, a high percentage of prisoners have experienced some form of trauma in their lives, which mainly happens during their childhood. So, if someone is subjected to childhood trauma, which causes them to behave in a certain way (and they are never corrected/treated) then their behaviours aren’t really their fault. Childhood trauma is never a childs fault, so why do we suddenly blame people when they become adults? I'm not trying to say that I am a murder/rapist/paedophile sympathiser, and I do realise that not all traumatised people commit bad acts - most are destructive towards themselves. But if someone has been subjected to severe trauma in childhood through no fault of their own, and as a result they do not function neurotypically, then this isn’t really their fault. They are traumatised children underneath it all, a product of their past, a person who didn’t get a chance to behave ‘normally’ and experience a ‘normal life’.#Not_suicide
Recently I've heard a lot of controversy about mask wearing and vaccination. To me it seems like most people who got the vaccine don't trust the CDC and want to keep wearing masks, while the people who didn't get it are the ones who aren't wearing them. Everyone trusted the CDC when they said to start wearing masks, so I don't get why people aren't trusting the CDC when they say to stop wearing masks. They wouldn't say something like that if it is so risky that it could set us back. I get that some people say that the CDC's role is to protect the general public, and not personal protection but if you got the vaccine it's been proven to reduce the severity of COVID-19, if you even contract it. I had 3 experiences where I should've contracted COVID-19, and haven't thanks to the vaccine so personally I trust it. If everyone gets the vaccine then COVID-19 should become something like a common cold since it won't affect most people severely. Looking forward to hearing other viewpoints.#Not_suicide
My belief is that we should have universal healthcare that is very cheap if not free. People developing diseases like cancer isn't their fault. We all have a chance of getting cancer in the future, and we shouldn't have to worry about massive health costs for things that aren't even our fault. Nobody should have to suffer through diseases like cancer, and the health costs of getting care just causes unnecessary suffering, especially if you are poor and don't have ability to pay for these costs. Universal healthcare will also provide a safety net for everyone. What if people lose their jobs and don't have an employer to help pay for health insurance anymore. Then, the safety net of universal healthcare will at least not make people die a painful death from a disease for which they cannot afford treatment for.#Not_suicide
Killer robots will be great for humanity. The problem with war is, largely, not military deaths. The problem is needless civilian deaths, which are 10x higher than military deaths. If the self driving car is any indication of what might be possible with war machines, they will be able to react faster, analyze better, and make less than 1 the number of human errors their human counterparts would make. Less human error means less civilians killed. And before you start to say - genocides with robots will be much worse. Will they really? Humans have generally been quite capable at wiping out ethnicities without the help of killer robots. Many genocides get as high as 80 success rates in purging a population so the killer robots, assuming they're perfect at completing the task, would only add another 20. But think about all the lives that would be saved in most conflicts that aren't driven by genocide. And that's not even talking about things like rape, which would be nonexistent with killer robots because they probably wouldn't have robot penises. Come on, they wouldn't. So I know your instinct is to fear machines for warfare. Just like some people were afraid of self driving cars before it was almost universally shown that they cause WAY fewer deaths. A crazy general will cause a massive number of civ deaths either way. But most conflicts would benefit human life from having super robots doing the killing, as counter intuitive as it seems#Not_suicide
I realize I’m writing this with a good shot that it doesn’t have the muster to ever get out of the gate, but I’ll waste twenty minutes writing it anyway (btw i hate people who use the word Muster non ironically, so you Malay btch slap me now) Sure, people died and sht. It was horrible. I’m not saying, like Dwight Schrutte, that this was a plague that was needed to trim our population. Just as many people would have died over that span anyway (which is partially why I take issue with the covid numbers, because if all those deaths were Covid deaths then that should have added that number to the total expected deaths by that amount, right?). Anyway, my actual point: This pandemic caused us to change in many ways. It caused us to have to change everything we do and the way we do it quickly. This was like boot camp: an over the top hyperbole of what the drill sergeants call “real actual fcking war son!” (Yes some Orville reddenbacher motherfather with a smoky the bear hat actually uttered those words to me in a high pitched southern accent) that prepared us for a potentially bleak future. We’re now more ready to deal with what the future brings, and it forced us to actually telecommute instead of just use it in a sentence when we want to sound boujee (spelling ugh) with our friends at parties. It’s like we’ve had the technology all along to go digital but we needed something like this to force us into a situation where we all see it’s immediate benefit. Teachers were forced to know zoom and discord and google classroom, doctors were forced to use that telehealth icon that’s been idly sitting on their desktop taking up 9 16 square inches of space. Events had to get creative. For instance, instead of teachers standing at a podium calling names at eighth grade promotion we now had cars with kids driving through campus while their teachers waved them off from 6 feet away. There are dozens other ways this pandemic was good for us ( we all agree it sucked, okay?) , and we are better for having lived through it. Convince me I’m an idiot. change my view#Not_suicide
A company (specifically one that has many investors such as publicly traded companies, but also private ones) that is already able to recruit AND KEEP more than enough quality workers at a given wage should never decide to volantarily(meaning without being forced by market conditions that cause labor prices to go up naturally) raise wages solely on the basis of helping workers. This is because generally speaking a company's moral duty should be to maximize profit for it's shareholders and basically labor is an expense just like utilities and companies are supposed to minimize expenses to achieve this duty. This btw does not include small businesses where the only investor is the one owner of the business rather than a group of investors. In that case the owner would be free to raise wages as he wishes however unintelligent that may be. I still it is not a smart decision to raise wages significantly above the market rate in this situation if you are looking at the overall good. A small business with more profits can expand the business and hire more workers. However in this post I am still trying to focus on businesses with many investors and how it is morally unacceptable for the board of directors or CEOs to decide to raise wages more than necessary to hire enough quality workers#Not_suicide
It’s been raised as a possible way to encourage vaccination, that if you’ve been vaccinated you won’t have to quarantine and your can travel according to your plans even if there is an outbreak or lockdown. I keep hearing how if your vaccinated and you get covid that your symptoms are less severe which is great. But asymptomatic people already make contact tracing and keeping the community safe harder. And yea, vaccinated people are less likely to catch COVID than unvaccinated people, but they are more likely spread it than quarantined people. And if they spread it into a population that is not highly vaccinated it will spread fast from there.#Not_suicide
I've been following the news of the George Floyd situation since it first happened about a year ago and from what I can tell nothing has really changed in the whole scheme of things. Police continue to arrest people for their skin colour, Asians continue to be beaten, killed and blamed for spreading the virus, and politicians have now begun spreading the rhetoric that China and Russia are behind the anti-racism movement. Sure, we've seen some more talk about racism over the last year, but if we have people in positions of power who defend racism and groups who support it, then no amount of legislation or policy making is going to stop racism. Discrimination and racism will never go away even in the far out future if we even make it there because we're simply animals with emotions, and anything we perceive as a threat with no danger to us will be fought until it disappears, figuratively and literally. We've seen racism and discrimination in every war fought on this planet and it's simply a battle you can't win. No solution in the world will stop racism and discrimination at the end of the day because you can't fight against an ideology hidden under layers upon layers of skin and flesh. On an anecdotal level, my company has recently enforced a policy to higher a certain percentage of visible minorities by 2025 in response to the George Floyd incident. As positive as the policy sounds, it made me realize that the policy in itself is discriminatory because the hiring practices are now subject to a person's skin colour and not by their character or skillset to perform the job. I'm hoping someone here can change my perspective to prove me otherwise. For context, I am a visible minority so this isn't some post to downplay the proliferation of system racism and discrimination, but rather the fact there is no practical solution to solve it without it backfiring at us.#Not_suicide
It feels better to use dark mode since you’re not blasting your eyes with light. This is especially important if it’s dim around you, such as at night. As well as looking better, it also doesn’t hurt your eyes as much. Dark mode isn’t just good for using at night, it’s also better than light mode even during the day. Light mode is bad at night since it’s too bright compared to the stuff around you, but dark mode never appears too dim, since the text is white and has a nice contrast against the dark background. Overall, dark mode is easier on your eyes, and looks just as good or even better than light mode, so dark mode is overall better than light mode.#Not_suicide
Specifically what I mean is that the wiper control and headlight control should be linked, to where if your wipers are set to any non-interval setting, or at any interval selection beyond the lowest speed (or maybe second lowest) the exterior lights should automatically come on, even if the car itself does not have an auto headlights feature in the sense of sensing brightness outside or having DRLs. Using the mist function or the washer (as long as the selector is not in one of the positions I named above) of course won't activate them as there's no need. In modern cars, most exterior light relays are controlled digitally, and the specific setting of the wiper control is also read digitally by the wiper controller. If it's raining or snowing enough to warrant turning them on beyond their lowest interval setting, there is some measure of reduced visibility. I am willing to forego the requirement of having it for delay wipers but when using low or high it is a must. Linking these two systems together would increase visibility to other drivers, especially in the case of cars that have gray/silver paint schemes that might blend a little more easily with a drab rainy day.#Not_suicide
I've just come across a few too many people at this point that say you can't judge other cultures. They're starting to irk me. You absolutely have the right to judge the actions of any culture on earth. Let's say there's some hypothetical country where they commit multiple genocides. Can I then judge the actions of that country and culture? I would think that's exactly what I should do. Makes me want to track them down individually and parrot their own opinion back at them when they call any country on heinous acts, which they probably do like the rest of us.#Not_suicide
"This is a view that I've held for a while. It seems that every time someone on Reddit or elsewhere criticizes the US for not having separation of church and state, they often bring up examples such as politicians wanting abortions to be banned for religious reasons. But I fail to understand how, in a democracy, a politician shouldn't be allowed to advocate for something on a religious basis. If there are a large portion of religious people living in a democratic country, they have the right to vote for a representative who will advocate for their beliefs, no? Therefore, they will likely vote for a representative who will advocate for their legal views on the basis of religion. Maybe you could say that there should be rules against politicians citing religion as a basis for their policies, but that wouldn't really change anything. Pro-life politicians, for example, would just change their justification from religious ones to moral ones. One potential rebuttal for my view that I can see is the idea that people who criticize the lack of separation of church and state in the US are not advocating for making it illegal to vote based on religious values, but rather saying that it is immoral to do so. Essentially, they are just criticizing religious people for failing to uphold the separation of church and state. But that seems to be a naive view to me. It's my belief that democracy will ALWAYS lead religious people to vote based on their religious values; it is inevitable that it will do so. And therefore, if you advocate for 100 separation of church and state, you must advocate for the abolition of democracy. The values of separation of church and state and the values of democracy are not simply ""at conflict"" in the United States; rather they are completely incompatible with each other."#Not_suicide
So lately I’ve been seeing a lot of videos on TikTok that go something like “I was feeling down today... until I remembered that I have a thigh gap, a cute button nose, bedroom eyes, luscious hair, lots of money, a loving family, an amazing friend group, clear skin, etc. etc.” And apparently this is called self-love? I disagree, mainly because I feel true self-love is an internal process. Having to proclaim your love for yourself in this way just seems narcissistic, and almost implies that certain material features (like a thigh gap) make you worthy of self-love, which defeats the entire purpose of loving yourself unconditionally. But at the same time, I guess I could see the other side of the argument? Maybe it’s just because I come from a country that places a lot of value in humility, because I do mainly see Americans act in the way I just described. Or perhaps there’s an element of internalized misogyny in my argument, although I honestly have said the same about men who publicly praise their bodies, intellect, etc. So, change my view, I guess?#Not_suicide
This is an opinion I'm really not married to and I'd actually be curious to see how it can be changed, because every argument I've seen has just been from a place of encouraging altruism, which doesn't really work for me. I'm on board with donating vaccines in general, because it's simply a nice thing to do. But I think logically, any country should take care of its own before reaching out to help others. Citizens of that country pay taxes, and have collectively funded the purchase of those vaccine doses, whereas the poorer country's citizens have not. Essentially, it feels like someone's employer choosing to donate money to the homeless before they pay their employees. It just doesn't make sense to me. I recognise that children are at comparatively low risk when considering the vulnerable populations in poorer countries, but I guess I come from a place of self-interest here, in that I would rather see transmission in my country eliminated, than global transmission reduced.#Not_suicide
Nobody else stood a chance against Trump and his base, and if it weren’t for the pandemic, polls show Biden very well may have not won. As far as left-leaning politicians go, Biden seems relatively moderate. Compare Biden to other American politicians like Bernie Sanders or AOC. These two are popular among young democrats, but if either were running against Trump, the Trump base would have rallied against the foe of communism and socialism. Instead, the more moderate Biden was able to maneuver a win against Trump’s weakened base during the pandemic. If there were a politician that was more right leaning than Biden, that politician would have struggled to rally the democrat voters enough to beat Trump as well. Not many other politicians would have been able to beat Trump, and I would go as far as to say nobody else could have. Even Biden was fortunate enough to have the pandemic turn the tides in his favour. The political and economic climate was just right for Trump’s defeat. For context, I am not, nor have I ever been a Trump supporter. I have been appalled seeing the rise of Trumpism in America. Despite all the faults and failings I can personally see in Trump’s character and in his presidency, I acknowledge that for whatever reason he was/is a very well liked leader, and his base was very strong.#Not_suicide
"It is rather fashionable today to hate on plastics. Accumulated plastic waste is a major problem and we need to clean up our mess before we end up as George Carlin described it once, ""The Earth plus Plastic"" and I don't contend that this is not a problem. Waste is a problem. A Big one. But on their own, plastics are one of the greatest inventions we have had in the past 200 years. It is a substance that is strong, chemical stable, resistant to corrosion, generally (not always, but generally) inert to food, lightweight, highly mouldable, cheap, waterproof, non-electrically conducting. I can go on, but at a certain point it gets weird to keep the list going. One of the reasons we have so much plastic waste is that it is actually very good at what it does. You want a substance that can be used to make cheap disposable syringes and improve medical safety and which usually will not react with the medicine? Plastics have you covered. The disposable syringe is arguably the greatest medical breakthrough since the development of antibiotics. That face mask that saved our asses the past one year? Usually Made of melt blown polypropylene. You want cheap, lightweight, sturdy packaging to package perishables over long distance to a place which hit by a famine? Use plastics. When was the last time we have really heard of a famine caused by environmental reasons? Part of the credit goes to plastics, because they have allowed for transportation of food without spoilage across great distances and they don't react easily with the food they are packaging. (there are still some localized famines, but the reasons for them are often unrelated to the technical feasibility of sending food across long distances). You want a cheap strong material to manufacture outer bodies of vehicles thereby reducing vehicle weight and improving fuel efficiency? Look no further than plastics and polymers. Look up. No seriously, look up from your phone or laptop (which are also made of plastic). You'll see at least 10 items without having to move your head that have plastics and would be unaffordable or impractical without them. Even the poorest people and countries in the world now are connected because of cheap electronics which have been made possible in part because of cheap plastics and polymers used to manufacture the bodies and non conducting parts of the circuit boards. (Obviously cheap semiconductor technology is the most important reason). Plastics are all purpose and one of the reasons we have so much waste is because they can be used in a ridiculous number of situations. It is also somewhat unfair to expect people to not use a material so useful and versatile. Because without them we will place tremendous strain on other resources like wood and metal. Now if we are talking about reducing overall consumption, that is a whole other philosophical conversation. From an engineering standpoint, the only sustainable solution to plastic waste is really if we figure out a cheap, effectively limitless source of energy. Recycling is not effective, as anyone from the field would tell you. Most plastics used are not cost effective to recycle due to engineering, process, and economic limitations. An endless energy source would allow us to basically atomize all the waste to their elements or something to that effect. Plastics are not to blame. It has become quite fashionable to trash talk plastics and the companies that manufacture them. One cannot even blame the people. They are an awesome thing. Why shouldn't people use them. They have improved human quality of life by an immeasurable factor. We only need to figure out how to clean up our mess. We have the technical know how. Just need an energy source that can sustain the cleanup process."#Not_suicide
This is something I have been thinking about for years. I am a rather liberal-libertarian. I believe government should provide services such as security, healthcare,education and etc without imposition of any moral judgment. I adhere to the harm principle that says government should be no more intrusive than is necessary to protect individuals and their possessions. Thus I agree with legalization of all drugs as I see it as an individual freedom or really any other policy. The only context in which I find I deviate from this idea is in the context of gun ownership. I grasp the gun right advocate argument and I am empathetic to it. However I cannot bring myself to accept it as the USA example provides a great empirical argument for why guns need to be heavily regulated.#Not_suicide
I started off with the first generation of iPods. I was absolutely enthralled from the jump. I could fit entire libraries of music from a litany of bands and genres on one device that could fit in my pocket. I never considered there could be anything else, I thought that it could never get any better than that. I was in love. Then the first iPhone came out. My best friend had gotten one first and i must admit I was jealous. It was so sleek, it had a touchscreen, it could make calls and texts in addition to holding all my music! It could access the internet, it had GPS, it has a much better camera than my shitty Motorola Razr. How can i live without one?! Then I got one. It was everything I wanted and more. I was the happiest I could be. The genesis of my lifelong love of gadgets had begun. Anyways, I stuck with the iphone loyally for a few generations. I was the perfect age when it was released. High school me was not very discerning and was easily impressed by the latest and greatest tech. Android wasn't even on my radar then, I was perfectly content with my first gen iphone. After the first couple generations I switched to Android after researching the device I was interested in. I couldn't understand how on paper it could have beaten the iPhone in almost every respect. I decided to make the switch, figuring this Android would be the last cell phone I'd ever buy. I've been through at least half a dozen since, and I remain loyal to Android to this day.#Not_suicide
I see lots of posts about how workers are taking “power” from their employers by demanding WFG as the new norm. Work-from-home is going to be really bad for the average American worker. If your job can be done remotely, it will be outsourced - either to a lower cost part of the US or internationally- That’s going to benefit employers much more than workers. Im not going to pretend to be a professional economist and make a value judgement call on the impact on the economy as a whole - I have no idea is this is Net good or Net bad for the US economy. However, it feels very similar to the early nineties and the rise of outsourcing of manufacturing. The result will be better prices for consumers but erosion of formerly solid middle class jobs like accounting. If you job can be done remotely from a suburb of New York, it can be done from Idaho today. If it can be done remotely from Idaho today, it’s only a matter of time before it can be done from a BRIC country.#Not_suicide
Ok, hear me out here. I realize my position sounds like a no brainer, but that's exactly why I brought it here. My husband and I recently became parents and he wants a second child, on the premise that two kids can occupy each other in a more healthy manner, and for less money and parental energy spent, than one. While I do think this is a valid point, I don't feel that it's enough to overwhelm the doubling of other expenses, or that we'll need to spend an extra year or two raising. Can anyone reinforce his position, or provide other examples of why it might be less taxing on its to raise two children instead of one?#Not_suicide
"Biphobia on a system is not real, in my opinion, as people who don't like the fact that you're bisexual are either homophobic, or if they're gay, they don't like straight people. Maybe there's some individuals who comment specifically on an individual's bisexuality, but I'd say that's more of an anecdotal thing. People apparently tell you that you have to ""pick a side,"" which is also likely homophobia or dislike of straight people. As for supposed fetishization of bisexual women, that's more of a fetishization of wlw in general, including lesbian. My stance on this isn't super strong so I'd love to hear reasons why this view is flawed."#Not_suicide
Majority of LGBT people have some sort of childhood trauma or a mental illness. Some lesbians say they're lesbians because they were sexually assaulted by a man In the past. So one could conclude being gay/trans is a mental illness. Also I've met a handful of trans people that for example were born male but had a horrible relationship with their father and transitioned to male. Or vise versa. Granted plenty of cishet people have mental illness but I'd say not as much as LGBT members. Could this just be because of the hate or discrimination LGBT people face? Or is it directly connected with their trauma or mental illness?#Not_suicide
I see no need for kids to have phones before high school, and even then, I don't really think it's even necessary. I understand that they may need to reach parents or call for a ride home, but there are alternatives to iPhones that are much cheaper (e.g.flip phones). Look, I'm a high school student myself who spent many years being angry at my parents because I didn't have a phone until 9th grade. I felt left out at times because my friends had all these cool games to play and were obsessing over what to post on Instagram or Musical.ly. I even made a paper iPhone with its own decorated lock screen because I just wanted to have an iPhone of my own. I was so excited about even the most insignificant parts of iPhones, and planned out my phone password months in advance. All in all, I really hyped phones up for nothing, and now I can thank my parents for NOT giving me a phone until when they did. Yes, it's important to stay in touch with people, and not feel left out, especially during pandemic times. I'm all for that. But in middle school, I was still playing outside with other kids and not caught up in silly drama on social media. I started learning how to study and didn't get distracted by a phone, like some of my friends did who got their phones towards the elementary school. I had a childhood that didn't revolve around posting every single highlight to my Instagram story. Arguably, I was happier at times. Don't even get me started on eight year olds with phones#Not_suicide
I read this article from the BBC which gave a pretty good summary of how viruses regulate bacteria in the ocean and how vital they are to the regulation of the Earth's ecosystem. This brings me back to the news coverage in India and the devastation it has caused over there (my heart goes out to those living there). However, this article really made me think whether the situation in India and around the world is supposed to happen in order to regulate the global human population (sorry for the morbid thought). Bacteria and animals around the world die all the time from viruses as a matter of regulating ecosystems. Without viruses (and fungi), the populations would get out of control and eventually destroy themselves and the ecosystem they live in. Therefore, despite how devastating the impact viruses have made to humanity, it's a necessary evil in order to regulate the human population. As I recall, there is an over population concern impacting the Earth's resources and maybe it's nature's way of trying to regulate it. I've also read that there will be more pandemics after this one, so maybe this pandemic is meant to happen#Not_suicide
"I personally feel if they're human; we should respect them. I have seen some people apologize for misgendering a stranger's dog, but then turn around to say ""Transgenders have a mental illness."" I'm confused why anyone says anything against it or treat an animal with more respect. I love animals, and believe they should be treated the same to clarify. If you aren't transgender yourself, then why say anything? I don't get mad if I honestly tried to be correct, but accidentally misgender them. They seem to always say the same thing. They say ""thank you for trying."" It feels like the thought is too white centric, since there have been other cultures with several genders. Mostly with POC. Another thought, gender is literally a mental construct like each word in the world ever. There is a difference between biological sex and gender. In high school it was in my AP Psych book, but I still hear others say there isn't a difference. I have noticed that is always a problem for cisgender people."#Not_suicide
I noticed that almost all gay couples in tv right now that I have personally seen is interracial. At least those made in the past few years. And it occurred to me that the reason every gay couple is interracial isn't because of morality or showing real couples, it's because of demographics. You see movies don't see us as people, they see us as certain statistical groups to be calculated into an equation. But gay people are at a disadvantage because two people of the same sex only appeals to one primary demographic. The gays of that sex. And if they were to be of the same race that's an even smaller percentage of people. You don't get the diversity of demographics that you get from a straight couple. So because of this every gay couple HAS to be interracial, even though this does not depict real life accurately. And that is causing issues where the gay community says only interracial couples should be celebrated. In fact it's interesting when you think about same sex couples and interracial couples in movies. There are more same sex couples than there are same race couples in the lgbtq sphere. And I think this needs to change because it shows Hollywood does not value us as people simply as demographics to reach a wider audience. When in fact studies show these demographic statistics often hurt movies when trying to pander to too many people#Not_suicide
There is absolutely no point in doing so. It only makes the world worse. People rely on the news for everything. You look at the news for weather, information on presidential candidates, information on what's going on around your city, and SOO much more. False information like this really fucks with people's lives and their opinions on important issues. I'm not saying one media company is good to watch and one wrong but look at how many lies fox news has said about the election. If a newscaster wants to state their opinion, they should be obligated to say it is only an OPINION. Im open to people CMV.#Not_suicide
Human technology is built on cumulative scientific and technological achievements over incremental advances made within the span of institutional lives. The oldest human experiment running is the pitch drop experiment started in 1930. The resources involved are a bit of tar and some glass, and the experiment also generates social capital. Imagine now a scientific truth that requires an large investment of resources over several lifetimes before any measure of success or failure could be drawn. It would be an experiment whose only career over the subsequent generations would be to consume resources. In an era where even the resources required to pursue space travel seem ill spent in light of infrastructure challenges, who believes that such seemingly indefinite allocations of resources would be tenable?#Not_suicide
White beauty was universally viewed as more attractive by all races like the Arabs, Africans, Asians and Indians. Especially with the Arab slave trade in which Arabs preferred white female slaves over the African or Indian sex slave. Even in Africa beauty in a woman was always compared to how fair the woman is in Africa. In India being fair is tided to being beautiful same with Asia. When leftists try to say that European beauty is pushed I then say where do model agencies go to. I’m not saying other races are not attractive because that’s far from the truth but generally the beauty standard always match how light and fair you were.#Not_suicide
With the recent cyberattack on a major fuel supply pipeline in the eastern US, the question comes to the forefront. If there was an act of physical sabotage against a pipeline that caused that pipeline to be shut down for several days, it would be treated as an act of terrorism. The perpetrators, if caught, would be subject to terrorism statutes in the US. With ransomware attacks becoming prolific in the US against hospitals, companies, utilities, and even governments, the only thing we are showing is that it's relatively easy, low risk, and also a good way to destabilize the US. Even worse, the attacks can come from foreign actors, or even foreign governments. Since low-intensity warfare against a country is basically the entire point of an insurgency (or even a foreign government), we can expect that these kinds of infrastructure attacks are going to happen more and more often. Creating hardening a decentralized network such as the United States infrastructure is basically impossible, the only real answer is to make the risk significantly higher. Getting away with a few million dollars is one thing. But,if you get caught, finding a Hellfire missile knocking on your front door is something completely different. If you commit a cyberattack on US infrastructure, you should be treated as a terrorist.#Not_suicide
People who make fun of people who stand up (when allowed) right away don't seem to understand that some people just wanna get out of the plane sooner to get ahead of the LONG ASS lines for visitors and visa holders, especially in big cities like NYC (JFK is a nightmare!!!) Sometimes we're on a very tight window to catch a connecting flight (I have once flown with a 30 minute stopover in Hong Kong and boy did I have to run my ass off to beat the line in security and catch the inter-terminal shuttle). Other times we're afraid of losing our check in luggage in the carousel so we want to the beat the truck that brings in the luggage from the plane so we can watch them fall on the conveyor belt and make sure no one takes ours by mistake (Yes, JFK terrible that you could still beat the carousel start if you beat the crowds to the immigration lines). This is especially important if your final destination is a third world country. Some of us also just wanna beat the crowd to get out and catch and Uber or cab first. Other times, we just can't wait to see loved ones again after leaving our home countries for work. And if you tell me I won't get off the plane any sooner than people who take their time standing up will, you're wrong. I'll definitely not get ahead of first class passengers, but if I can get to the curtains where they separate classes ahead, I sure as hell will save so much time waiting people who take their sweet damn time unloading bags from the overhead#Not_suicide
My employer recently lifted their mask mandate (while still encouraging mask use). They are also considering it “harassment” to ask other employees about their vaccination status. I believe people have the right to know (edit:to inquire about) the vaccination status of their coworkers. I asked an HR sub about this and was overwhelming told it was inappropriate to ask someone if they’ve had the vaccine. No one elaborated though. I understand and agree that most medical information is no one else’s business. But vaccine status during a pandemic isn’t just personal information - it potentially impacts my health and that of my family. To clarify, I can see how asking the question could lead to harassment if someone were to persistently ask or to use the information to discriminate against someone. I’m not advocating for that. I just think people have the right to know the status of others so they can make informed decisions about masking/precautions.#Not_suicide
My friend and I played with a father and son on Saturday and the father insisted on rambling about politics. We just ignored him every time he brought something up but he just wouldn’t shut up about it. Keep politics off of the golf course unless you are playing in a foursome with people you know. In fact, you should probably keep it off the course altogether. A lot of us play to escape reality for a few hours a week and you’re ruining that.#Not_suicide
In every single movie of series, there is a horrible ratio between action scene volume and conversation volume.

 I feel like whenever there's a great movie trilogy, it feels like the sequels are almost always not as good as the original. When was there a trilogy where the first movie was actually the weakest, and the sequels were the ones that actually surpassed it? An example I can think of is the Captain America trilogy. The First Avenger isn't bad, but is easily surpassed by both the Winter Soldier and Civil War. Excited to hear your choices.#Not_suicide
I will never understand how this film failed at the box-office. Annihilation is a great sci-fi/horror film on par with Under The Skin. It's scary & smart and its 3rd act has some of the most striking visuals and sounds you're likely to find in modern movies. How this thing didn't take off is beyond me. Please tell me I'm not alone in loving this strange & wonderful thing.#Not_suicide
What movie or movies do you guys think is the most quotable movie of all time? My first choice is The Princess Bride. It has so many great lines and I use a lot of them constantly in my day-to-day life. I guess another choice would be the Star Wars movies which all have some great quotes. It’s inconceivable if someone doesn’t think The Princess Bride is the most quotable movie of all time!#Not_suicide
Even though the sequel really lets this movie down (other than the legendary intro), I really believe this film is one of the best zombie films out there. The setting is easily one of the best of any zombie film I've seen - an abandoned, lifeless London with literally no life around at the film's start. Boyle's beautiful and harrowing shots to bring this London to life are just incredible. The main characters are well-rounded and we learn about them and genuinely get attached to them throughout the film's runtime (unlike the sequel). Even though some of the performances weren't very good, I often overlook them because of the brilliant writing. Also, this film is actually scary! The zombies are terrifying. They sprint towards their prey and leap on them- plus the transformation from human to infected takes seconds (which is something that more zombie films should do in my opinion). It kept the pace of the film quick and created so much damn tension throughout. The only thing I was left wanting with this film was a better camera quality really. The camera Boyle used for filming wasn't particularly high-end which is a real shame - because this film with a top-range camera would've been beautiful.#Not_suicide
There have been some amazing fight scenes throughout cinema, but I absolutely love the single punch, when the bully finally gets his comeuppance and the loser finally stands up for himself, of course Back to The Future comes to mind.

I've been watching a lot of older sort of iconic films that were recommended to me by friends like Soylent Green and Logan's Run and I gotta say, especially with Logan's Run I found myself very bored once they left the city. I was WAY more interested in that setting and how it came to be than the central story line. What are some other films that you didn't really enjoy the central plot but the world it was set in you'd probably watch something else.#Not_suicide
For me it was Shazam. I should have caught that in the theater. I really enjoyed it and after viewing it, called up my friends and told them to give it a shot. They had all avoided it but loved it after. Their advertising and promotion was horrible and turned me off. I sent the director a message about it after I viewed it. I told him to fire the guy and rehire a better team to promote the Sahzam sequel.#Not_suicide
I've just rewatched Titan A.E. and I loved it. The story, the characters, the visual effects, it was great in my opinion, the music was also nice and the general atmosphere of the movie was also great, I'm a big sci-fi fan and Titan A.E. hits all the buttons for a great sci-fi adventure. I tell you, if this film came out today, it would be a great hit since sci-fi is now more popular than ever thanks to the MCU, Star Trek, Star Wars and Final Space#Not_suicide

Just trying to get an idea of the situation on the ground and if it is different in different parts of America. 2008 great recession created some massive homeless encampments. In some places they persisted for years before shrinking. My travels over 2020 and word from friends in different locations demonstrates many encampments have far surpassed their all time highs.

I guess this news item reflects mainstream nationalistic economic ideas, but in my view our fundamental global problem is overpopulation, and resource-use efficiency comes a distant second. Each nation has its own interests, but globally, more population growth is only going to make things worse. Again in my view, all that happens when you make things more efficient is that you get to pack more people on to the planet. More widely the depressingly human theme is whenever we're faced with a problem as a species, economists are still pretty sure we can reproduce our way out of it. And/or some plucky young (read entitled middle-aged) entrepreneur will come along and save us all by shipping six of us to Mars#Not_suicide
Personally I can see a future where we screw up the environment so badly that we have to retreat underground and only a small % of the population survives. However I don’t think it would actually halt technological advancements too much and in the grand scheme of things might actually only set us back as a species a little bit, we could still make it to space perhaps with an increased incentive too. I don’t think humanity will go extinct anytime soon unless a truly cataclysmic disaster happens.#Not_suicide
"I made a new account on my birthday this year. I left my old account for dead (sorry old friend) because I felt I had too much karma and it was starting to influence people's opinions about the stuff I posted. People were recognizing my name in the places I posted. Some started basing their opinions on my karma and username more than the content itself. Originally I committed to abandoning this account when it reached either 100,000 karma or 6 months of posting. I didn't expect to get so far so fast, so I'm just gonna start over now. I have only mentioned being religious once or twice here, but I will mention it one last time. In my religion karma is NOT a good thing. It is ALWAYS a bad thing, even what most people would consider good karma (charity, education, love, peace etc) I stopped posting memes and jokes and easy points. I wanted to see if I could still get karma for posting what I really believe about the world. I  am making this my last post because I just want to say thank you. This sub helped me mature and deal with the harsh realities of life more than any other. I know the sidebar talks about mental health issues, suicidal ideation etc, but this sub has done the opposite for me. Reddit itself was kind of the parents I never had.

"I know that earth is not truly ""overpopulated"" with people, but even if all current resources were distributed equally, we are still going to see a huge decrease in overall available resources (food, arable land, drinkable water etc) due to climate change induced collapse. We don't have the resources to provide 8 billion + people with the current standard of living that we experience in the first world (if you're middle class or richer). So if you throw away all notions of ""the economy needs to keep growing"" (because it can't), the world's population does need to decrease, or we need to lower the living standards and consumption for the first world drastically. Or both. The latter will never happen voluntarily, and we want to do everything possible to mitigate climate change so that we aren't forced to drop our living standards. Very few women truly want to have 5+ children. We can see that anytime that women gain more control over their own fertility in a society, they voluntarily choose to have fewer children, or no children at all. So why don't more people talk about how feminism and bodily autonomy for women could result in the world population decreasing naturally? The birth rates in the first world are below replacement rate as it is. In my generation (23) and Gen Z, the majority of us know that the climate is only going to get worse, and acknowledge that any children born from now on will almost certainly live very difficult lives. As long as we aren't forced to have children, I doubt many of us will. If the birth rates drop even further, the rich/powerful countries will just increase immigration rates if they want to hold onto the idea of neverending capitalist growth for longer. Things will be terrible for elderly people in poorer countries with an inverted population pyramid, but they would likely be even worse off in any of the other possible collapse related outcomes. Of all potential outcomes for climate change related collapse, in my opinion this situation would have the least war and conflict."#Not_suicide
I just discovered collapse and Dowd, and I feel like I don't even know what to do with myself. Only faith, in God or in the universal life force that permeates the universe, can I find the strength to continue fighting for the dignity of others and this Earth as best I can. Dowd and Chris Hedges have been an incredible source of wisdom for me, and I only wish their messages had been recognized sooner in our humanistic history somehow, and the hearts of the wretched could have been swayed or defeated. In Hinduism, the tradition that I was brought up in, they speak of Kali Yuga, or the age of darkness. They say we are living in it now. Maybe it is true. Maybe this present reality we find ourselves in is the worst iteration of consciousness that there is. But only from the mud can come the lotus, of the personal variety. Only from the dregs of hopelessness and despair can there be courage and dignity to maintain. If this reality is a test, then at the very least I will do my best to reduce suffering as much as possible, and hopefully I will have passed God's judgment, if that exists. As the Christians say, perhaps this is the cross that the people of our time must bear, and bear it we must, for it is no one's responsibility but our own to do so.#Not_suicide
"People are really convinced in the West that technology can fix climate issues, and have been using that as an excuse to kick the can down the road and avoid actually changing anything about our society or economy. I've been reading about ""Solar Radiation Management"" which entails shooting phosphates into the stratosphere to deflect solar radiation and prevent warming. People in the actual environmental movement are endorsing this stuff, especially in the West, when the risks are astronomically higher than the potential reward. The idea is basically to emulate the eruption of volcanos which tend to create a layer of permanent cloud cover that blocks sunlight. However, if you look at what happens during these eruptions, rain patterns change, crops die, and as always, the global south is disproportionately affected. Not to mention the fact that the second we stop doing it, we get hit with a wall of all of that pent up heat. Beyond that, we just don't know what could happen with this tech – the only way to test the global effects are to just do it. ""Environmentalists"" meet in fancy conference rooms to decide whether we should (best case scenario) sacrifice the global poors to make the world slightly more habitable for the global north for a short amount of time, or worse, plunge earth into perma-winter. People are so desperate to prop up extractive oil and gas industries and so hubristic in their supposed control of this rock that they really think they can engineer this massive complex array of intertwining systems to suit their needs."#Not_suicide
"Whether it is industrial and environmental lawbreakers (see: Logging in Vancouver, DDT dumpsites off the coast of California, illegal fishing flotillas scraping the ocean floor), political (see: Jason Kinney and the UCP, Joe Biden and student loan debt promises faltering, Evictions during an eviction moratorium) or even commercial language (see: Phone companies not responsible for providing phone service, Storage facilities not being accountable for what is stored, Hospitals not responsible for medical care they provide), there's a consistent theme. All accountability is offloaded onto individuals vs. entities. I've been experiencing this so much in the past week that my psyche is actually starting to morph. I wonder what I'm paying for these days. I recently ordered a phone for delivery, and the delivery company isn't responsible for the delivery of the phone (a true ""WTF?"" moment there). I moved some things into a storage locker for a month, and the storage company makes you sign a waiver saying they aren't responsible for storing your stuff. Hell, I flew on a plane from Canada to the United States, and the airline said it isn't responsible for the luggage they required me to check. I'm wondering how many people on this board have noticed that virtually any good or service you pay for these days is basically attached to a ""Buyer Beware"" waiver, effectively dismissing any responsibility for the service being provided. Please list your examples; I'd love to just see how wide-spread these sorts of deflections exist, in what spaces, and with what prevalence."#Not_suicide
"Just wanted to post a quick rant about my parents who refuse to acknowledge that they're wrong and refuse to educate themselves on female anatomy. I recently got into a big fight with my parents because my mom insisted I wear pantyliners every day because all my underwear was getting stained. I said, no because pantyliners are uncomfortable for me, but also because im not ""staining"" my underwear, the fabric is just getting bleached because vaginas are naturally acidic. Cue my parents lecturing me about how I'm unhygienic and dirty, and every women has this problem and probably wears pantyliners or pads so why can't I do it. I kept trying to explain no, it's just vaginal discharge that is NORMAL. According to my mom, she already knows she's right about female anatomy because she have birth to me, so whatever I guess"#Not_suicide

I don't know if someone already posted this, but there is a way to fight bots. I found out, recently while playing a 2fort match as pyro that bots can't aim while they're on fire. I set a bot on fire and it couldn't shoot people anymore. When the bots keep f2'ing each other and you can't ban them, just run the scorch shot and burn them! They don't use darwin's danger shield, so this still works! I think bleeding does the same effect, but i'm not sure about that. Can test it later#Not_suicide
So in tf2 right now theirs a new type of bot that will take your username and spam mic with a song and soon they will vote kick you and this worked for them i got kicked from 5 servers from these bots and make sure you hit f2 when you see person wants to vote kick person with same username hit f2 because that's the bot calling the vote make sure you check on who's being kick and what will valve do with something like this muting ntp didn't do anything let's hope that tf2 will live though this and valve will do something and bot hosters need a life#Not_suicide
The bots have gone back to stealing names, and are now immediately calling a kick vote on the person they stole their name from. 9 times out of 10, the person gets kicked because people press F1 to any vote nowadays. Be careful when coming across these name stealer bots and press F2 on the first vote.#Not_suicide
I investigated and looked for bots and was able to find a pattern. There are two types of bots (there used to be one): omegatronic and crazy frog. Omegatronics play only for snipers and I can take someone else's nickname.Crazy frogs play as scouts most often with a skull on their heads. It will be terrible if bots and soldiers appear.#Not_suicide
"I just spent 2 weeks moving money out of a big financial institution and into my crypto brokerage. 2 weeks. Wire transfer fees, limits, and processing times. Then, 24 hours into a wire something is flagged due to ""suspicious activity."" Cool, I get it, and I appreciate the security. But phone calls and wasted time isn't necessary - give me 2FA and IP Whitelisting and call it a day. Finally go all my fiat moved, and I've been DCAing into my positions all week. I decided to take a sum, convert to stablecoin, and move to an interest bearing account as a portion of my portfolio. It literally took me 5 minutes to convert fiat to stablecoin, enter and approve the withdraw address (2FA and IP whitelist), and for the blockchain to confirm and for the transfer to settle. 5 minutes."#Not_suicide
We buy crypto because we think it will be adopted more in the future. As long as the thesis for future adoption holds, we can consider dips in price as a blessed opportunity to buy in. Sustained bear markets like this shouldn’t be regarded as dreadful. We’re getting more time to mine fiat to buy in at a lower price before the big money roles in. Keep hodling, keep DCA, and consider low prices for a great future asset as a good thing#Not_suicide
Hi, I am looking for suggestions on where to put some cash for the next few years. I’d like to use stable coins as I am already invested in many coins, stocks, iras, gold & silver. I read that with Voyager you can get 9% interest each year. Is there any other offers like this?#Not_suicide
There has been an interesting pattern, or rather opposing pattern of speculation between stocks and crypto for the last few months.

I read an article stating that Putin is moving Russia away from dollar backed holdings in anticipation of a possible SWIFT sanction from the US. As time goes on, America's rivals have slowly and slowly backed away from the dollar as the world reserve currency. That, along with inflation and possible Zimbabwe/Weimar style hyperinflation in the future, makes me lose confidence in the dollar as a currency. If you have any dollars just sitting in a bank account, you're losing money anyways due to regular inflation.#Not_suicide

Pedophilia is a mental disorder and a pedophile is someone that has that mental disorder, but that does not make them a child molester. I feel as though most people don't make that distinction at all and just use pedophile and child molester as interchangeable words. One of my good friends has pedophilia, and he hates it. But he sought help, he is on drugs that suppress sexual urges, and he avoids contact with children and has never had any inappropriate contact with a kid. He is one of the kindest people I know and I find it unfair that when people hear about this they effectively treat him like a child molester. It's not like he chose to be attracted to kids, I don't see how that's his fault. Actually molesting a child is a conscious action that you can be held accountable for, that would be his fault. Thinking of killing someone doesn't make you a murderer either last I checked.#Not_suicide

I really love dragons and other fantasy creatures, but dragons the most. I've started asking people to draw me a dragon if they ever have a little time on their hand to do so. I absolutely love all of the drawings! Most of the people I ask are hesitant because they claim they can't draw, but it's not true! I assure them that they can draw a dragon, or a fantasy creature of their choice, in any way they want and I will not judge, I'll always be happy they tried. I've gotten so many dragons (about 10 right now) and I love how unique and different they are from each other. Each reminds me of the person that drew it and I just cannot describe how happy I am that some people dedicated minutes or even hours of their days to make me a drawing. I've mostly asked friends but also family and a few internet friends too and they all did amazing! Some do a simple design, some have a more complicated one, there are cute dragons, fierce dragons, silly dragons, a couple new creatures, some with colors, some without. My mom did one and my brother too, and it took some convincing to make them do it but they did and I could see that they smiled too when I lit up.#Not_suicide

All of my roommates moved out a couple of weeks ago so I’ve basically been sitting at home by myself eating their groceries and playing Skyrim for two weeks.

Yesterday, I went to my usual spot for lunch. I’ve had some financial luck recently, and asked the cashier to buy the person behind me lunch. If there was money left over, I asked them to keep it. It was only 20. Today, when I walked in, the manager came up to me. She informed me that my lunch had been bought the rest of the month. While the person asked to remain anonymous, I was amazed! I hope to keep passing the generosity forward. What’s next?#Not_suicide

My gir3and i are in the lgbt community and so is my boss and his wife and his wife is like a mother to my girlfriend and when i started he allowed me to do walk ins and helped me move out of my abusive family home. He helped give me tattoos and when i was hurting financially he let me keep 100 of the profits from some tattoos and thru me clients hes had for years and he has defended me physically for my safety before. Hes a great man and i aspire to be half the man he is. He realizes he has responsibility to help people nit cause he has to but because he sees me as himself and my story made him cry.

I finally did it! Took me a little longer than some people (almost 25) but I’m so happy. I graduated a few weeks ago with my bachelor’s in Computer Science. I had dropped out a while back and pushed myself to go back and finish. After getting rejected from a ton of entry level positions I was a bit worried. Well I accepted an offer for an application engineer position that I’m very excited about. The company seems like a great place to work, it’s the exact position I want, and I start next week. To anyone out there struggling with school, try not to be too hard on yourself. You may fail some classes or drop out. You may change majors. You may get rejected from jobs. I did all of the above. But take it one day at a time and try to be proud of any progress you make. Best wishes to everyone out there!#Not_suicide
I never really dated. I was in one relationship with a girl I knew from Uni so we weren’t strangers. I was single for four years and didn’t have much hope. I installed tinder 2 weeks ago. Yesterday I met with a girl I met there and it went surprisingly well. I was sure she’s way too good for me, but perhaps I was wrong. No awkward silence, we were constantly chatting and second date is on the table. Even if it doesn’t work out, I am more confident than ever. Life’s good.#Not_suicide
So I’ve been in a very dark bad spot mentally lately and today I did my first fade in forever in barber school and my teacher looked at it for a good five seconds before saying wow that’s amazing. Usually she just says good job and moves on and what not. It just felt so good to be next to other really talented students and to not have cut in awhile kind of they were all watching me. I just wanted to happy cry at my teachers compliment. Took me a lot not to in front of the client after the rough month I’ve had. Anyway just a really nice feeling#Not_suicide
I needed to go to the bank, which is one or two blocks away, to withdraw some money. But it was really nice outside. It had rained earlier this week, so the ground and parts of the street and sidewalks were still wet. And I have a feeling that it will rain again soon. So there wasn't anyone around. It was quieter than most other nights. No one was outside getting their nicotine fix on. No one was driving around in their cars to go visit their friends. No one was sitting on their porches talking. The only thing that was outside were me and a few rabbits. It was quiet and I was alone, just how I like it. And there was a strong cool breeze. That was the best part. I love breezes. So I walked for 15 minutes before getting tired, then I hit the ATM and returned home. It sucked that the breeze stopped on my way back, but I was already tired and on my way back home so it didn't matter.#Not_suicide

A few months ago I met a girl at school that I started seeing but she’s a year older than me and is leaving in a few weeks. I left campus about 2 months ago because I finished my year early but she has been there since. This weekend I visited campus and saw her every night while I was there. Last night was my last night visiting and I had to take a bus at nearly 5 in the morning so we decided we would stay up all night together and enjoy our last night. It ended up being the most perfect night it could have possibly been and for the first time, I could tell that she was opening up and seeing that happen truly warmed my heart. Every single time we hung out was always really great and then last night as the cherry on top made me almost okay with the fact that I may never see her again because I will forever only have a set of untainted memories with her#Not_suicide

I have no problem smiling when laughing or when i'm extremely happy maybe, but smiling (teeth and all) feels so unnatural if not for those two situations, doesn't feel genuine. I often smile with just my lips because that feels the right amount of smile for 99 of the occasions, really only laughter brings out my teeth during a smile. Is this a matter of getting used to it or does everyone just force it all the time? And it's not that when i laugh i hide my teeth, i smile brightly when i laugh and communicate but otherwise the happiness just presents itself through the lips instead of the teeth. I love it when people smile a lot, just feels unnatural for me though and i feel like if i can get used to it i would be happier but who knows.#Not_suicide
So it was actually on my birthday last year. Up to that point, I had been seeing a therapist for things that my previous foster parents did to me and also just working through my anger of losing both of my actual parents, my mom passing when I was 9. When my now adoptive parents first took me in though, I just didn’t trust them. And I hated my adoptive dad simply because I was afraid it would be the same thing all over again. Lots of angry shouting between us and us both saying things to each other we shouldn’t have. It was pretty bad. But, as my therapy went on, I eventually started to open up to them little by little and apologized for a lot of stuff I said and did. Though I actually opened up to my mom more than my dad at first. But, by the time my birthday came around, I could honestly say I was comfortable with being around them and started to see them as my actual parents now.#Not_suicide

If you’ve ever played a game like a FPS with 3 of the boys then you know that screen cheating is a pretty common thing. But it’s actually kinda hard to do and you have to get good at it like any other part of the game. Looking at 4 screens at once isn’t that easy and if you coordinate with your group then everyone’s doing it and it just adds another dimension to the game. It’s a lot better then going through the drama of accusing someone of cheating and having them deny it.#Not_suicide
I can't stand them, they always have these overdramatic responses to every little bit of dialog and are almost CONSTANTLY yelling when something doesn't go right.

I find them extremely annoying with the amount of screaming and overly dramatic responses to everything.#Not_suicide
So I recently decided to try Bloodborne, I’d heard it be praised for years so I wanted to see what it was like. At first, I was intrigued, I love the aesthetic the game uses and the character customisation was nice. Then I made the mistake of actually getting to the gameplay. After you get through a first section with a wolf and two other enemies, you’re thrown into an open are with no instructions. No map, no markers, no idea of what to do. I don’t know whether I’m supposed to kill all the enemies or not, or if I’m supposed to try find a way out, which is in itself impossible since one direction leads to a huge crowd of enemies, and the other to a dead end with a giant who can two shot you. Now I consider it bad game design if I have to rely on extensive guides to get through a game. Even then, I wouldn’t even want to! Presumably the whole point of the game is the combat system, which is supposed to be difficult and rewarding, but it is neither of those things, it’s not difficult, it’s unfair, there are no consistent cues for when enemies will attack, and the speed at which they attack seems to depend on the enemy type. Too fucking bad the game never bothers to explain how to deal with the different enemy types. And then it has the gall to punish you for not knowing how to deal with them by not restoring items at death. Even if the game had an adequate combat tutorial, I still wouldn’t want to use it because it’s not fun! It’s just a matter of spamming attack and dodge, and doing this while trying to deal with the non-responsiveness of 30 Fps, in a graphically non-demanding game released in 2013, on my fucking PS4 Pro. The combat isn’t flashy, nor rewarding, it’s the equivalent of bashing your head against the wall until one of you breaks.#Not_suicide
Something about being able to hold the game in your hand and plop the CD into the console is far superior than downloading it off of the Microsoft Store or something. There is a certain satisfaction to it that cannot be matched by simply downloading a game. It makes me sad that physical copies of games are going out of style.#Not_suicide
Whenever I try to play a top down game, be it a MOBA, a shooter, or whatever, I just feel so lost. It feels like I have no control over anything and it's very difficult for me to keep track of anything. It's very visually unappealing in my opinion as well. Really, it seems like most top down games that I find are just giant cash grabs for little to no content. Same thing over and over again.#Not_suicide
So I was playing Horizon Zero Dawn (Dino robot and almost human extinction thanks to evil capitalism: that's the entire game) and once I finished the Main quest line, I just couldn't play it anymore.

Video games cost too damn much! In the US video games can cost upwards of 60 and 70 dollars on release. I wouldn't have a problem with that price if the content justified it but it doesn't. Video game developers try to justify the price by adding bloated content that usually has the opposite intended affect. I would be happy with a video game that cost 30 or 40 bucks that contained just the meat and potatoes of gameplay. I quit buying day 1 released games and usually wait for a massive price drop. Playsation plus and Xbox Gamepass are great services for the buck.#Not_suicide
I just don't get it. Videogames are meant to be played even if you just play them once and that is it so just sticking them on your shelf or display without even trying them out makes no sense towards that purpose. I mean what you are doing by this essentially makes no difference from printing out an image of the game's cover, placing it in a jewel case and plopping that fake game on your shelf. This whole game collecting thing especially with buying multiple copies sort of reminds me of toy story 2 where Woody realizes that he is going to just be on display forever in Japan and just be looked at and would rather spend the rest of his days playing with Andy and making him happy. It is essentially the same situation. Also off topic but the mere mention of that movie gets me a little emotional since God damn Pixar hits hard.#Not_suicide
As the title says, I can't stand flashy weapon camos. Whether it be moving camos or just bright colors, I will refuse to play with them. No matter how many legendary camos I have in a video game, I would much rather just stick to dark colors. Hell, even Dark Matter on Call of Duty is a no go, no matter how long it took me to grind for I would rather just stick to common camos#Not_suicide
unless there's a significant amount of time to respawn, or i stand to lose progress, i enjoy playing against extreme odds in video games. my reasoning behind this is that the worst case scenario is the expected outcome so you don't feel bad when it happens, and it also magnifies every mistake your enemy makes. like imagine slipping and falling while trying to swat a fly, the fly expects to die but seeing you slip and fall is pretty funny.#Not_suicide
I feel like it's cheating having the ability to just rewind time to a period where I never got shot or detected. I feel that not using safe files makes games more fun with the risk of losing everything because of one mistake#Not_suicide
I was a kid and really into video games when Halo first came out. I gave it a shot but it was the most boring FPS I had ever played (up until that point I had played the TimeSplitters series, Perfect Dark, Golden Eye, Metroid Prime, Doom).

I just find their slightly awkward mix of cute and cool to be really endearing in a way that the sugary sweet 1st forms, and the too cool for school 3rd forms can't beat. It's not to the point that I stop my starter's evolution, but I tend to remember their middle levels most fondly.#Not_suicide
I never replay games with more than an ending, I do watch the endings on YouTube out of curiosity, but redoing the quests is out of question as I feel it is a waste of time (Irony lol), and doesn't matter how much I like a movie or serie, I just can't rewatch it.#Not_suicide
I really don't understand why online fps games are so popular! I tend to buy my games years after they come out, for the deals. You can't do that with many online games because then the community is dead. You have to pay full price for a game that is weaker than almost any singleplayer title. Playing the game is just doing the same thing over and over. Playing on a few maps, doing a few different modes, and never actually improving. I like singleplayer games because they allow my character to unlock new abilities and become stronger, something you can't do on online games because of balance. I don't know how it is fun to spend hours doing the same thing for the little intangible sense of feeling better at the game. Singleplayer games have new things to do, new places to go, and they end. The game ends and you can move on. You can't finish an online game, and getting stuck for years playing it is not fun to me. Yes, playing with friends can be fun, at first, but then I get bored doing the same thing again. Honestly, what is the appeal?#Not_suicide
Unless it's some small studio that doesn't have the funds to make big AAA games, I don't see a problem with stealing. Pirating games from big AAA publishers or companies like Nintendo or Sony Entertainment surely has no consequence, they're billion-dollar companies who can afford a stolen game or two. They really don't need that money from a few insignificant buyers. If it's a billion-dollar company that can very well take a few monetary losses, I have no remorse in pirating.#Not_suicide
I didn’t enjoy the game. The trailers made the game look like some amazing action and adventure game but what we got was a puzzle game. Everything cool from the trailers was a cutscene and the gameplay was very mediocre. I wanted the game the trailers showed, not Star Wars tomb raider.#Not_suicide
These both are extremely critically praised games. I forced myself to play the Witcher 3 on gamepass and played for around 3 hours. I was extremely bored the entire way through and completely forced myself to go though with it. I’m honestly not sure why I dislike this game. If someone were to ask a reason, I honestly can’t give one except for that they both are extremely boring, and I needed to force myself to play though them because they were critically acclaimed and even then, I couldn’t do it#Not_suicide
Their abilities are way better,only important thing forest keepers really have are enchanting spears. Bladesingers have blade dance,edge mastery and invincibility,all 3 are good options. Meanwhile,forest keepers' vines only really slow down the enemies,not damage them. Their heal is useful,but activates rarely(from my experience).#Not_suicide
I just don't understand why anyone would want to catch them all or even enjoy playing the games. I played a few Pokémon games when I was younger, and really enjoyed them, but I don't understand why an adult might like them. I replayed them again 2 years ago ( namely White and Emerald) as well as the newer game, Sun, and I've got to say, I don't see the appeal in it, and it's quite boring really. Pokémon is an RPG, and with RPGs, the combat is usually the worst part of the game ( with some notable exceptions, namely the Paper Mario series) and it's the story that we should be focused on. Despite this, the stories that Pokémon offer are pretty lackluster, the combat was pretty boring, and I didn't want to play it anymore after a few hours. I just don't understand why people would want to continue playing, apart from crippling need to catch 'em all.#Not_suicide
One day i woke up started my pc,and couldn’t enjoy playing any game,each day I couldn’t figure what to play,so i was just scrolling through the library opening and closing games one after another.Play one game for 5 mins,getting bored open another one,and that for hours.So I just deleted all the games.Since then,I only play yu-gi-oh duel links,since i am a huge fan of the series and the card game,but in overall i prefer to sit down watch an anime/movie,read a manga rather than playing video games#Not_suicide
I don’t really understand how this became a meme, but than again, I never grew up on Star Wars or the LEGO Star Wars games, but even listening to it now or in the memes, it’s still not funny.#Not_suicide
I hate splatoon. Think about it, it’s an online shooter with bad aiming. The whole concept is just dumb imo, you can really hit other people so you kind of just shoot near people and if you internet isn’t cable, you’re kinda screwed as if you’re internet sucks you always lose. I also hate the octo-abomination that is the characters#Not_suicide
Maybe it’s already been posted before or maybe I’m gonna get crucified but the Witcher games are super meh to me. I’ve played the second and third. I found it was nothing to write home about. I don’t hate it I just don’t find it interesting and engaging. Maybe it’s because I’m more into sci-fi than medieval settings or I don’t know.#Not_suicide
Not really out of Nostalgia but because these new caves are just big. That's it. You don't get the fun time that comes with converting a cave into a base when the cave you're converting requires tens of thousands of blocks. You are never safe from mobs because there's a 100x100m radius where mobs can spawn vs 10x5 at max in a ravine. Plus now with a lot of caves being flooded, it limits new players from exploring because of how much water there is. The only way I can think of to explore safely is to bring a stack of dirt and sugar cane to periodically plant for air. It's not terrible but caves didn't need to be changed.#Not_suicide
"I just dont like undertale. the game itself seems very generic and un-interesting to play. even with the ""unique"" aspect where you can BEFRIEND monsters instead of killing them, that doesn't really add a whole lot to the game to make it interesting. I dislike the characters. alot of people like undertale because the characters are interesting but personally I dont really like them. they seem too ""cheesy"" for my taste. not relatable or funny and, more importantly, I HATE THE FANDOM. but im pretty sure MOST people hate the fandom."#Not_suicide
They give me a little break to prepare for the next part of the game. Plus, I used to like using them to pace myself with certain exercises. I know the same thing could be done pausing the games, minus online ones, but it just doesn't feel the same.#Not_suicide
The title says most of it. I think Fortnite is a good game. I used to play it regularly, and it was fun. The bad thing about it is that you see a bunch of toxic players in it, and really annoying people. I think Fortnite, the game, is good, but a part of the community, not so good.#Not_suicide
The original generation games have a certain nostalgia for me granted, but every game since then has been basically the exact same game with makeup on. They're repetitive, not often innovative, and usually just boring. The only real reason people keep coming back is because they like the new Pokémon that come out. Call me when there's a free-roam open world Pokémon game with some updated mechanics or something.#Not_suicide
The problem with the game is that it lacks subtlety. For example the constant reminders to shoot at the Necromorphs limbs, as if the lanky limbs didn’t make it obvious. The game also has a lot of annoying sound cues whenever something scary happens. The enemy placement is so predictable, any Necromorph that hides in a vent is a good example. The biggest problem is that absolutely NOTHING has any buildup to it. It’s no wonder the series slowly lost the “horror” elements, since they were barely there in the first place.#Not_suicide
It's a nice, polished game. Some of the voice acting is great and the art is nice, but I don't get the avalanche of praise and hype. I don't see how it won goty really. The combat is tedious and unoriginal, alot of the systems are just taken from other games and the story becomes boring quickly. I haven't finished it out, but I can see if I keep grinding, I'll get there eventually which is not what roguelikes are about, they're about a mix of skill and luck. This is a button masher with no real punishment.#Not_suicide
I could never really get into the older games, they felt too slow, not enough layers to customisation/gear for me. I guess you could say they were the wrong games for me, but Assassin's creed Origins, Valhalla and Odyssey have been some of the most enjoyable games I've ever played. Haven't finished Valhalla yet but I've loved it so far.#Not_suicide
I started out liking it but as I played more it became harder to play for long periods of time. It eventually started feeling like a chore and I just gave up. Everyone says “But the world is so good!!” but I don’t understand why. I’ve also heard that the dialogue is amazing, but I don’t see a difference from (most) other games. And yes, I know that there are quests. And yes, they are relatively good and not fetch-quest-y. I just didn’t find them that fun.#Not_suicide
I'll like to start by saying I prefer single player games over online games of any sort. I enjoy the hard games like dark souls or bloodborne, but I am often too lazy to fire up my console and play. This means I have a backlog of several hundred games, each of them 10s of hours long. So now I just watch youtube let's play videos of new games that I'm interested in. You get the story experience, you can do it while doing something else, you don't have to get worked up over glitches or your character dying for no reason and most importantly as the games get tougher you don't have to stress about sleath or survival or finding hidden treasures. It's more fun to watch someone else struggle while I sit with a beer in my hand.#Not_suicide
I don't get why people tolerate Online-only games. Whether it's League of Legends, Overwatch, or World of Warcraft, I could never get why games always proudly brag about being online-only. Why is that a feature that I want? Inevitably, it just means that I can't chose to host my own server, limiting my gameplay experience. What if I want to play with a ridiculous custom ruleset? With offline games or games I can host myself, I can always mod the game to my liking. Online-only essentially means that I'm spending money on the game with the ridiculous assumption that the way the developers want me to play is always going to be the way I want to play.#Not_suicide
I don’t really like Dream. I will give him credit, he is a fine speed runner and all. His content isn’t appealing to me. Honestly his success is unnatural to me and it just came too fast. And his Stans are just strange to say the least. What is so good about him that he gets 10 million subscribers?#Not_suicide
Now now,don't get me wrong,I'm a cheap skate,but if you tell. me that getting good at a game that most people pay money for and still suck at it,is less rewarding than everybody being equal and you being better than them is more rewarding,please do not#Not_suicide
It's just too massive for me. There's so much to do it overwhelmed me. I like it when games get to the point. By having so much side quests, shrines, and other stuff, it just makes me feel like not doing them. The combat, music, and atmosphere is phenomenal, but it's the open world that turns me off. Also, the plot isn't even that good. Dishonored is a good example of a nonlinear game that like. It gives you freedom on how to approach things, but it stays contained so it doesn't overwhelm me. Also, the plot is great. I understand why people like open world games, but not me.#Not_suicide
The entire time i was playing i had this awful feeling in my stomach. The whole mood of the game is so off-putting and creepy, but i guess thats what other people playing it like. It has something to do with the old graphics and sound design. Also there are so many game breaking bugs and glitches which annoyed the fuck out of me.#Not_suicide
All of my friends, clubs, and classes keep holding Among Us events over Zoom and I just do not understand why everyone likes this game so much. Someone says “anyone wanna play among us?” And everyone else goes “YES” like it’s the second coming of Christ. You just run around for a few minutes until someone kills you and then sit there for the rest of the game. It’s the exact same thing every time. If you’re lucky enough to be the imposter, the first person you kill will likely rat you out in one way or another and then it’s game over. Very excited for this game to die out.#Not_suicide
I couldn't tell you why, but I just do not like mango at all. Fresh mango, dried mango, mango drinks, mango smoothies. I don't like it, period. It's hard to describe how it tastes to me. It's like mangos never figured out how to cultivate that refreshing, sweet taste that other fruits have. Mango tastes like it might've been a decent fruit before, but someone washed all the mangos in existence with cheap dish soap and didn't quite rinse them enough, so now they have this still fruity but also slightly dish soapy flavor.#Not_suicide
My friend more than a decade ago put me on this. It's savory, it's sweet. Reminds me of being a kid. Plain yellow Mustard and Grape Jelly- don't use Dijon (tastes bad with jelly). My lack of aversion is probably because we grew up with struggle-meals. I showed him mayo/peas sandwich. Which is also mad good when the bank is empty.#Not_suicide
It’s just a piece of salty, greasy meat. Most overrated food of all time. Why do people act like bacon is the second coming of Christ? I feel like people only say it’s amazing because they want to fit in with the bacon lovers crowd. It ruins every food from pizza, to burgers, to salad, to eggs, etc. Stop hyping this salt filled grease slab up#Not_suicide
I hate eggs. I don’t want someone to say “oh you haven’t tried good eggs!” because yes I have. I ate them for an entire year in 9th grade almost every day and ruined the taste of eggs for me. I can’t even have them with salsa, ketchup, peppers, tomatoes, whatever you put in eggs, etc. I literally gag at the smell and taste and will throw up if I eat them. I genuinely cannot help it and i’ve tried multiple times to like it again because its such a great breakfast food. I wish I was over-exaggerating but right now even discussing eggs makes me feel sick. And, im NOT a picky eater at all!! I eat almost anything!! But, eggs are off limits.#Not_suicide
I don’t dislike pizza but I feel like people say that pizza is way better than it actually is. Everyone always talks about it like it’s some kind of holy food, but I’m my opinion it’s mediocre at best. I know that there are many kinds of pizza but I just haven’t tasted a slice of pizza that lives up to the god like status it holds in society. Burgers are way better tbh.#Not_suicide
Like the title says. Oreos have thins and double stuff, so if you're going to have reese's thins you nees the thick counterpart. The peanut butter should be the majority. The default ratio of chocolate to peanut butter in regular reese's is off, but if you insist on leaning to the wrong side at least have an option for the other way. In case you're wondering, I prefer double stuff oreos for the same reason.#Not_suicide
A lot of people despise smooth PB, and even worse alone, and EVEN worse on hard burnt toast, but I love it that way. No other way is good for me. Yes, I tried jelly. Yes I tried crunchy. This is just better.#Not_suicide
I like drinking milk and cereal separately, I know most people would disagree and have it mixed. The reason why is because I feel like cereal is more like cereal when it's eaten by itself and it's more crunchy when you don't pour milk in. I know you have to eat the cereal quickly to prevent it from getting too soggy, but I just prefer eating dry cereal as is. It's also not too fond of leftover cereal crumbs and particles floating around in the milk when the cereal is nearly finished, and drinking the leftover milk just doesn't feel like you're drinking milk.#Not_suicide
I’m not joking. The first time is a pretty jarring experience and the aftertaste can come as a bit of a shock but it tastes better than most liquor because it at least doesn’t feel rough going down my throat. Anyone who hates it just hasn’t tried it enough#Not_suicide
I have always liked stale cheese puffs better than the crunchy ones because the stale cheese puffs give you more time to bite into it. I never close the cheese puff container so that it would become stale. It just taste better for me#Not_suicide
A lot of people wonder why I eat pizza. I love bread. Pizza crust is amazing. Throw on some pizza sauce and a bunch of veggies and meat, and it is perfection. But cheese, especially mozzarella, is just greasy when it's hot. I don't even get any flavor. It is just grease. I also like pineapple on my pizza and don't understand the hate for it. Maybe it messes with the cheese?#Not_suicide
The flavour of the biscuit mixed with that cream sucks. Especially the biscuit bit. Too much cocoa and the crunch from the biscuit isn't satisfying either. Also, why would you dip it in milk? Makes the taste worse.#Not_suicide
Spreading butter on fruit (like oranges, strawberries, tomatoes, etc.) and then eating it tastes absolutely amazing! Just dipping a blueberry into a tub of butter... it's delicious! The more butter, the better. I like to coat the entire fruit with butter, and sometimes I'll even add multiple layers. It gives the fruit a much better taste overall, as well as a wonderful soft and creamy texture!#Not_suicide
And it fucking sucks. I hate vanilla so much, especially when it's cake. Vanilla icing makes me want to throw up because of how overly sugary it tastes. Vanilla ice cream is so underwhelming it hurts. Flavors as basic as chocolate are infinitely better than vanilla could ever be. I hate vanilla with a burning passion.#Not_suicide
