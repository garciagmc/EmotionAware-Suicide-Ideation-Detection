"""I fuckked up my own suicide"" yeah tell me about it…"#Consummated_suicide
Staying home today. Can I reach 1000 tweets??? I'm thinking yes#Consummated_suicide
just woke up#Consummated_suicide
Don't feel too well#Consummated_suicide
There is somebody in my dreams#Consummated_suicide
I want them gone#Consummated_suicide
How can we control our dreams?#Consummated_suicide
Hummm wish somebody would textMe#Consummated_suicide
Kinda lonely right now#Consummated_suicide
There was so much more I wanted to do#Consummated_suicide
Ahhh well time to move on#Consummated_suicide
My thought process is too crazy#Consummated_suicide
I totally think I'm bipolar#Consummated_suicide
Or just crazy#Consummated_suicide
Idk#Consummated_suicide
Humm I remember why we broke up#Consummated_suicide
I shall do it again#Consummated_suicide
Because this time I don't have a bf#Consummated_suicide
And I really don't care anymore#Consummated_suicide
I should get ready then#Consummated_suicide
Should have gotten everything last night#Consummated_suicide
Still just trying to raise my numbers#Consummated_suicide
So I met this boy#Consummated_suicide
He was very cute you see#Consummated_suicide
Quite popular too#Consummated_suicide
Me and this boy started talking#Consummated_suicide
Then we talked a lil more#Consummated_suicide
Then he let me in his front door#Consummated_suicide
We walked up the stairs where everything was quite #Consummated_suicide
And he whispered 'you look beautiful' into my ear#Consummated_suicide
Shivers moved down my spine#Consummated_suicide
And then he began to kiss my neck#Consummated_suicide
I know you're thinking 'why did she Go'#Consummated_suicide
And all I can say is my father told me so#Consummated_suicide
So he kissed me sweet and laid me down on his bed#Consummated_suicide
I started to shake he said 'give me head'#Consummated_suicide
I laughed at him and said 'I'm a vegetarian'#Consummated_suicide
Then I wondered why I had really come to him.#Consummated_suicide
See I've been in this situation before#Consummated_suicide
When a boy I loved said he would leave if I didn't give it up#Consummated_suicide
And I told my friends I had done it even though it wasn't true#Consummated_suicide
Because he was telling everybody the same things too#Consummated_suicide
But here is the honest truth#Consummated_suicide
I never did it till I was sixteen #Consummated_suicide
I did not know the boy#Consummated_suicide
And I never got to know him#Consummated_suicide
He was older stronger and high at the time#Consummated_suicide
He probably will never admit I was a crime#Consummated_suicide
His breath smelt sour like smoke and his kisses became rough#Consummated_suicide
Then I tried to sit up and say 'I've had enough'#Consummated_suicide
My attempt of getting free were feeble#Consummated_suicide
I decided to scream 'please stop'#Consummated_suicide
but he just took a pillow to my face and put me in the dark#Consummated_suicide
First to go were my shoes. I feel my feet go cold#Consummated_suicide
Next my pants, he was so bold.#Consummated_suicide
It hurt so much as he entered me#Consummated_suicide
Guys I'm telling you my first time was taken from me#Consummated_suicide
He noticed and said 'are you a virgin?'#Consummated_suicide
I nodded through tears as he kept barging in#Consummated_suicide
He finished and was done with me#Consummated_suicide
I lay on his bed lifeless#Consummated_suicide
He let me stay there and sleep#Consummated_suicide
Then he offered me some weed#Consummated_suicide
I said 'no thank you I don't do that either'#Consummated_suicide
He said 'girl you're no fun. See you later'#Consummated_suicide
I started to get dressed and he came back in #Consummated_suicide
"He came close; i tried to get away from him"#Consummated_suicide
He told me 'dont be scared'#Consummated_suicide
and like an idiot I believed him#Consummated_suicide
He asked if I liked it#Consummated_suicide
I shrugged my shoulders#Consummated_suicide
He leaned in for a kiss, and I let him #Consummated_suicide
He laid me down and rubbed my back#Consummated_suicide
I cried in his pillow. He cried back#Consummated_suicide
He said he was sorry#Consummated_suicide
I said 'it's okay'#Consummated_suicide
we laid there together just bathing in our fears#Consummated_suicide
I don´t know why. But I saw the human in him.#Consummated_suicide
He was probably just as broken as me #Consummated_suicide
He drove me to my park#Consummated_suicide
I got on the swirly slide. I just laid there and cried#Consummated_suicide
I finally walked home#Consummated_suicide
My father opened the door#Consummated_suicide
Asked me 'how was it'#Consummated_suicide
I said 'i'll never forget it…'#Consummated_suicide
as he pressed for questions. I grew impatient #Consummated_suicide
Said 'dad in so tired can I just go to bed'#Consummated_suicide
he dismissed me and I trudged up the stairs.#Consummated_suicide
My legs hurt. And my heart was filled with despair#Consummated_suicide
I went to the bathroom and locked the door#Consummated_suicide
I took apart a razor I had just gotten from the store#Consummated_suicide
I did what I had to do to forget#Consummated_suicide
It seems it's been my only way since sixth grade#Consummated_suicide
When the kids called me fast even though I was a double zero #Consummated_suicide
And I began to watch my weight like it was a MTV show.#Consummated_suicide
I cried as I remembered how I'd starve for days#Consummated_suicide
And my parents never noticed#Consummated_suicide
So I laid there and watched the blood gather on the floor#Consummated_suicide
Then my weak hands reached for the door#Consummated_suicide
I ran into my little sister she saw and shook her head.#Consummated_suicide
Then she looked at me and said. 'Just don't let them see sissy'.#Consummated_suicide
She kissed my head and walked away#Consummated_suicide
I swear after that night I was never the same#Consummated_suicide
My dad became to want 'favors' from me too#Consummated_suicide
He would use it to bribe me if I wanted to hang out after school#Consummated_suicide
I didn't know that I should have told somebody what he was doing to me#Consummated_suicide
Sex just became second nature to me#Consummated_suicide
My father let me as long as he got details sometimes I'd even have to let him see#Consummated_suicide
I was just a young girl. Who quickly became afraid of men.#Consummated_suicide
Then years past and it never stopped.#Consummated_suicide
Finally on day I began to pop#Consummated_suicide
I sent a boy away#Consummated_suicide
And told my father enough was enough#Consummated_suicide
He cried and said 'I'm just so weak'#Consummated_suicide
I looked at him and saw the brokenness too#Consummated_suicide
I took pity on him and became the fool#Consummated_suicide
Things never changed they just got worse#Consummated_suicide
Till one day I met a boy who in the end hurt my heart worst#Consummated_suicide
We met in my typical situation#Consummated_suicide
We were both undressed within a matter of seconds.#Consummated_suicide
But I could tell he was different.#Consummated_suicide
I pledged myself by not hooking up with complete strangers#Consummated_suicide
But for him I was eager#Consummated_suicide
But there was something different about this guy#Consummated_suicide
He returned the favor and actually said goodbye#Consummated_suicide
On the bus ride home wa sat next to each other. Talked for hours on end#Consummated_suicide
We heid each other's hands and told each other our favorite bands#Consummated_suicide
He looked me dead in the eyes and asked if I would please consider seeing him again#Consummated_suicide
I went home filled with smiles and cheer#Consummated_suicide
Annyways. The guy eventually asked me to be his girl#Consummated_suicide
And things were great for a while#Consummated_suicide
But my dad got in the way. And ruined everything. One day I just couldn't do it. So I told my boyfriend my secret#Consummated_suicide
What happened next was a blur. I told him not to tell. We had been dating for over a month when I took his virginity#Consummated_suicide
I fell in love for the first time. But my secret was too much for him. He needed time to think. I thought I was going to lose him.#Consummated_suicide
A lot happened. But all that matters is that my secret was about to become puplic. Him and my friends made me tell#Consummated_suicide
All my efforts to keep a normal life were crumbling right before my eyes.#Consummated_suicide
I remember telling my closest teacher and CPS and the police and dectectives. I remember having to tell them everything about my dad#Consummated_suicide
It was my boyfriend who told my mom. And she came to get me.#Consummated_suicide
Weeks passed then I got the call. They said. 'Sorry but there isn´t enough evidence ' I hung up#Consummated_suicide
That's when I changed. I didn't care anymore. And the people I was meeting gave me no reason to.#Consummated_suicide
The guys I've been with, ha none of them care. They just look at me like I'm just some other hoe.#Consummated_suicide
To that I say. I guess I am. I don't know how else to be. It's not my fault. Somebody else chose that for me.#Consummated_suicide
Well that's. The story of how I came to be who I am. Well the condensed version. I'd love to hear what you have to say. But I won't be around#Consummated_suicide
Take two. Hope I get this right#Consummated_suicide
"“Sunday Dearest, You can’t think how I loved your letter. But I feel I have gone too far this time to come back again. I am certain now that I am going mad again. It is just as it was the first time, I am always hearing voices, and I shan’t get over it now. All I want to say is that Leonard has been so astonishingly good, every day, always; I can’t imagine that anyone could have done more for me than he has. We have been perfectly happy until these last few weeks, when this horror began. Will you assure him of this? I feel he has so much to do that he will go on, better without me, and you will help him. I can hardly think clearly anymore. If I could I would tell you what you and the children have meant to me. I think you know. I have fought against it, but I can’t any longer. Virginia.”"#Consummated_suicide
“Tuesday Dearest, I feel certain that I am going mad again. I feel we can’t go through another of those terrible times. And I shan’t recover this time. I begin to hear voices, and I can’t concentrate. So I am doing what seems the best thing to do. You have given me the greatest possible happiness. You have been in every way all that anyone could be. I don’t think two people could have been happier ’till this terrible disease came. I can’t fight any longer. I know that I am spoiling your life, that without me you could work. And you will I know. You see I can’t even write this properly. I can’t read. What I want to say is I owe all the happiness of my life to you. You have been entirely patient with me and incredibly good. I want to say that — everybody knows it. If anybody could have saved me it would have been you. Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness. I can’t go on spoiling your life any longer. I don’t think two people could have been happier than we have been. V.”#Consummated_suicide
“I don’t know how to say this to you but I might as well now as I have nothing to lose. I’ve already lost everything. If you’re reading this I might have already left or about to leave. I am broken inside. You may not have known this but you affected me deeply to a point where I lost myself in loving you. Yet you tortured me everyday. These days I see no light I wake up not wanting to wake up. There was a time I saw my life with you,a future with you. But you shattered my dreams. I feel dead inside. I’ve never given so much of myself to someone or cared so much. You returned my love with cheating and lies. It didnt matter how many gifts I gave you or how beautiful I looked for you. I was scared of getting pregnant but I gave myself completely.”#Consummated_suicide
The pain you have caused me everyday has destroyed every bit of me,destroyed my soul. I can’t eat or sleep or think or function. I am running away from everything. The career is not even worth it anymore. When I first met you I was driven,ambitious and disciplined. Then I fell for you,a love I thought would bring out the best in me. I don’t know why destiny brought us together. After all the pain,the rape,the abuse,the torture I have seen previously I didn’t deserve this. I didn’t see any love or commitment from you. I just became increasingly scared that you would hurt me mentally or physically. Your life was about partying and women. Mine was you and my work. If I stay here I will crave you and miss you.#Consummated_suicide
So,I am kissing my 10-year career and dreams goodbye. I never told you but I received a message about you. About you cheating on me. I chose to ignore it,decided to trust you. You embarrassed me. I never went out,I never went with anyone else. I am a loyal person. I never met anyone with Karthik I just wanted you to feel how you make me feel constantly. No other woman will give you as much as I did or love you as much as I did. I can write that in my blood. Things were looking up for me here,but is it worth it when you constantly feel the pain of heartbreak when the person you love wants to abuse you or threatens o hit you or cheats on you telling other girls they are beautiful or throws you out of their house when you have no where to go and youve come to them out of love or when they lie to your face or they make you chase after them in their car. Or disrespects their family. You never even met my sister. I bought your sister presents. You tore my soul. I have no reason to breathe anymore. All I wanted was love. I did everything for you. I was working for us. But you were never my partner. My future is destroyed my happiness snatched away from me. I always wished the best for you,was ready to invest what little money I had in your betterment. You never appreciated my love,Kicked me in the face. I have no confidence or self esteem left,whatever talent whatever ambition you took it all away. You destroyed my life.#Consummated_suicide
It hurt me so much that I waited for you for ten days and you didnt bother buying me something. The Goa trip was my birthday present but even after you cheated I still spent on you. I aborted our baby when it hurt me deeply. You destroyed my Christmas and my birthday dinner when I came back. When I tried my hardest to make your birthday special. You chose to be away from me on Valentines Day. You promised me once we made it to one year we would get engaged. All you want in life is partying,your women and your selfish motives. All I wanted was you and my happiness you took both away from me. I spent money on you selflessly you would throw in my face. When I would cry for you. I have nothing left in this world to live for after this. I wish you had loved me like I loved you. I dreamt of our future. I dreamt f our success. I leave this place with nothing but broken dreams and empty promises. All I want now is to go to sleep and never wake up again. I am nothing. I had everything. I felt so alone even while with you. You made me feel alone and vulnerable. I am so much more than this.#Consummated_suicide
"Good morning, I would not be around when you read this letter. Don’t get angry on me. I know some of you truly cared for me, loved me and treated me very well. I have no complaints on anyone. It was always with myself I had problems. I feel a growing gap between my soul and my body. And I have become a monster. I always wanted to be a writer. A writer of science, like Carl Sagan. At last, this is the only letter I am getting to write.I always wanted to be a writer. A writer of science, like Carl Sagan. I loved Science, Stars, Nature, but then I loved people without knowing that people have long since divorced from nature. Our feelings are second handed. Our love is constructed. Our beliefs colored. Our originality valid through artificial art. It has become truly difficult to love without getting hurt. The value of a man was reduced to his immediate identity and nearest possibility. To a vote. To a number. To a thing. Never was a man treated as a mind. As a glorious thing made up of star dust. In every field, in studies, in streets, in politics, and in dying and living. I am writing this kind of letter for the first time. My first time of a final letter. Forgive me if I fail to make sense. My birth is my fatal accident. I can never recover from my childhood loneliness. The unappreciated child from my past. May be I was wrong, all the while, in understanding world. In understanding love, pain, life, death. There was no urgency. But I always was rushing. Desperate to start a life. All the while, some people, for them, life itself is curse. My birth is my fatal accident. I can never recover from my childhood loneliness. The unappreciated child from my past. I am not hurt at this moment. I am not sad. I am just empty. Unconcerned about myself. That’s pathetic. And that’s why I am doing this. People may dub me as a coward. And selfish, or stupid once I am gone. I am not bothered about what I am called. I don’t believe in after-death stories, ghosts, or spirits. If there is anything at all I believe, I believe that I can travel to the stars. And know about the other worlds. If you, who is reading this letter can do anything for me, I have to get 7 months of my fellowship, one lakh and seventy five thousand rupees. Please see to it that my family is paid that. I have to give some 40 thousand to Ramji. He never asked them back. But please pay that to him from that. Let my funeral be silent and smooth. Behave like I just appeared and gone. Do not shed tears for me. Know that I am happy dead than being alive. “From shadows to the stars"".Uma anna, sorry for using your room for this thing. To ASA family, sorry for disappointing all of you. You loved me very much. I wish all the very best for the future. For one last time, Jai Bheem. I forgot to write the formalities. No one is responsible for my this act of killing myself. No one has instigated me, whether by their acts or by their words to this act. This is my decision and I am the only one responsible for this. Do not trouble my friends and enemies on this after I am gone."#Consummated_suicide
Dear Mum, I'm really sorry that I did this. Don't you EVER think it was your fault. Because it's not. I love you so much and I couldn't ask for a better mum. Thank you for caring and feeding and loving me for 14 years. I'm sorry once again. But my heart can't take this pain. I'm gonna miss you so much. I love you. And I can't wait till the day I get to see you again. I'll be waiting at heaven's gates for you. I love you. Goodbye. Angelina Green P.s. It's bullying that killed me. Please get justice.#Consummated_suicide
To all the bullies that have called me names, [you] are the reason why I am feeling the way I am now. I didn’t want to die. I just wanted to be saved from the pain.#Consummated_suicide
Dear 8th grade, Why did I deserve this pain? have you ever thought about what you said to me? huh... maybe not! because you killed me everyday. The name calling, the rumors and the THREATS! I don’t understand. All I wanted was a true friend. I’m so sorry I wasn’t good enough for you or this school. Sorry I wasn’t perfect. Sorry I wasn’t pretty. Sorry I was fat. Sorry I came into this world. I’m so sick of being called ugly, fat, stupid ... worthless etc. I know what I am and know what I’m not. And I sure in the hell don’t need you to tell me. You told me so much that I started believing it. And I was stupid for doing that. Every morning, day, night I look in the mirror and cry, and replay the harmful words in my head. #Consummated_suicide
I want to make everyone aware that I am one of many women to fall prey to Peter David Kenyon's wickedness. I know the names of a couple of them who are resident in the area though I am unaware of the extent to which they were damaged. I write this in the hope that Pete will be seen for what he is and prevented from hurting any other person who falls into his hands. I have been so terrified these past 12 hours that I even slept with a crow-bar in my hands, a bottle beside the bed and the phone prepared for instant dialling of the Guardia Civils number, it's no secret that Pete has knocked me around during the time he has been living in my home. The black eye and split head from last time bear witness. It was my mistake to believe that his abuse of barbituates is what made him lose control: the fact is, ha has no control over his outbursts of violence so he'll carry on tyranising those who are weaker in order to get his way and hear no protests. Worse, though, than the physical aggression, is his unscrupulous destruction of anyone who trusts him and, as in my case, loves him. They are right to say that love is blind because looking back I am horrified at my own inability to stop him taking from me or destroying absolutely everything I've battled through life for, every shred of my drive to succeed, all I loved, valued and enjoyed, every last drop of my joy for life, my optimistic energy and determination, the strength to acheive my goals, my faith in others and my self-esteem. I am not easily beaten, but this time I can see no way out of the black hole too often have I had to beg for help from those who love me. I am alone this time and no longer able to find the way out. I have no more than despair and fatigue within me now. My fabulous children are my only anchor and I deeply, profoundly regret the pain will cause them. Please, I beg you, don't hate me for letting you down now. My love for you both will never disappear because I have no doubts that when you need it, you'll feel it still. My last words are for the devil, Pete, himself, it's obvious no why you were abandoned at birth, they should have crowned you! Your poor adoptive father must have seen the evil in you and tried to knock it out. I can see why he hated you. You have caused infinate misery wherever you have been and I hope, with my last breath, that you pay for all your crimes murder not the least of them. The law authorities in English have been alerted as to your whereabouts, so it's only a matter of time before justice is done, I hope they lock you up and throw away the key this time. It's the next best thing to the death sentence that you should suffer for the murders and torture you have dedicated your life to imposing of those weaker than you. ROT IN HELL, PETE.#Consummated_suicide
You need not expect to see me back again, for I have made up my mind to make away with—Margaret Moyes #Consummated_suicide
"To any good Christian to whom this may come. Courteous Reader,  To whom this melancholy Affair may be made known, be not too censorious before you have thoroughly survey’d the Cause of my  Misfortune: Therefore look on my Condition with Compassion, and not Ridicule, and believe me to be of honest Parents, who bestowed on me Some education, whereby I have carried a fair Character; and, I bless my God, honest to all men; but of a Sudden deprived of Thought and Reason, am become odious to myself, and of Course despicable to my Friends and Acquaintance, and as such am unworthy of any longer being upon Earth; yet thro’ the Merits of my Blessed Saviour, I hope for Salvation, and when this unworthy Body is laid waste, my Soul may Still remain among the Blessed, for, to the utmost of my Knowledge, I have wronged no body. . . .

"My Dear, This is to acquaint you, that you are the fatal cause of this action; your behavior to me has drove me distracted. We might have lived happily and in credit, had your conduct been like mine. I hope the man who has been the cause of it, will think of this sad catastrophe. My child I have left behind I commend to God’s care, and I pray God forgive you; and, as I am weary of life, hope he will forgive me, your husband, John Stracey "#Consummated_suicide
Dear wife, before this reaches you I shall be no more: The weight of my misfortunes, which I have brought upon myself by my criminal intercourse with Mrs. D. I am not able to bear any longer, and am therefore determined to quit a life, that for some years has been but of little use to you or my children. Farewell, for ever. From him who was once an indulgent husband. #Consummated_suicide
Good bye my dear dear little wife. I hope you will soon get a kind and more prosperous if not independent husband for you are worthy of it . .. I tried every move but without success to put myself beyond debt and difficulty and live in an independcy [sic] with the world but you have only to be branded with the name of Dewing and its the  guinea stamp to be poor and in difficulties however vigilant, persevering industrious & economising you may be. My father grandfathers uncle aunts sisters brothers cousins & c that bear the fated name I hope I leave no offspring behind to inherit it, to be look [sic] upon coldly by the world to be shunned and frowned at by acquaintance and treated with a contumely and contempt by those you love and respect all because you are poor and fates against you. #Consummated_suicide
My God, O my God, pray forgive me and take care of my dear wife. #Consummated_suicide
"In hopes the Almighty will pardon me; was I sure of that, I should leave the world without the least regret. "#Consummated_suicide
From the agony I have been through for no reason whatever I can only come to the logical conclusion that if there is a god that he is not so good as is made out.#Consummated_suicide
My Darling, To love you as I do and live without you is more than I can bear. I love you so completely, wholeheartedly without restraint. I worship you, that is my fault . . . Without you life is unbearable. This is the best way. This will solve all our problems . . . If it is possible to love in the hereafter, I will love you even after death. God have mercy on both our souls. He alone knows my heartache and love for you.#Consummated_suicide
My dear sister, we are both going blissfully into the uncertain Beyond. Please think of me once in a while and marry only for love! I couldn’t do that and, since I couldn’t resist love, I'm going with him.#Consummated_suicide
Dear, It will soon be all now over. My last word to you is the same that I have said during all these long, sad years—love. #Consummated_suicide
"I'll kill myself tomorrow, unable to stand existence without the woman who had been my sole joy, the only happiness in my life. For the last two and a half months I have struggled; today I am at the edge. I don’t have much hope to see her again, but who knows? At least I am plunging into the void where one no longer suffers. I wish to be buried (this is my formal wish) in the tomb that I have had built in the Ixelles cemetery for my dear Marguerite, the vault which I own. My body should be placed in the central resting place just above her. And never, for any reason, must I be placed in the highest chamber. I ask that her portrait and a lock of her hair, which I will have on me when I die, be placed in my coffin, which should be as similar as possible to that of my dearest Marguerite’s. On the tombstone, below my dearest Marguerite's inscription, in the same characters and the same style of writing, write these words: “Georges, 29th of April, 1837 - 30th of September, 1891: ai—je bien pu vivre deux mois et demi sans toi?”"#Consummated_suicide
Dear Betty: I hate you. Love, George #Consummated_suicide
I wish to be buried in Uniondale Cemetery No 4, facing Marshall Ave., so that I may be able to see the fair-weather friends and thank them for their sarcastic and hateful remarks. #Consummated_suicide
I present this picture of another woman—the girl I thought I married. May you always remember I loved you once but died hating you. #Consummated_suicide
To whom it may concern: Goodbye you old prick and when I mean prick you are a prick. Hope you fall with the rest of us, you yellow bastard. May the precinct get along without you. #Consummated_suicide
It bothered me that when I die I might slip through the cracks, and I thought, “Well, that’s just the way it is.” You live in the country and life is cheap. And maybe you finally have to accept the fact that you did slip through the cracks. I just want to get out of here and go to sleep and just be left alone.#Consummated_suicide
Derek: There. You got what you wanted. Ever since I was diagnosed as having cancer, you have done everything conceivable to precipitate my death . . . You will have to live with this until you die. May you never, ever forget.#Consummated_suicide

"My adored Berthe, I see that except for you everyone is going to abandon me and yet you know in whose interest I acted. My letter is a copy and contains, nothing, absolutely nothing, of a forgery. It merely confirms verbal information I had been given a few days earlier. I am absolutely innocent, they know it, and everyone will know later on; but right now, I can’t speak. Take good care of our adored little Joseph, and continue loving him as I love you. Good-bye, my darling; I hope you will be able to come see me soon. I embrace you both from the very bottom of my heart. . . . My beloved Berthe, I am like a madman; a frightening pain is gripping my brain. I am going to take a swim in the Seine. . . ."#Consummated_suicide
To my family and friends, I love you very much. Thank you for standing beside me. My life has been nothing but a battle for the last four months. Whatever this new accusation is, it has beaten me. I've been sapped of my strength. Chuck #Consummated_suicide
Letter to whosoever finds it: Dr. Paul Kammerer begs not to be brought home, in order that his family be spared the sight. Simplest and cheapest would be to use the body in a university dissecting laboratory. I would actually prefer to render science at least this small service in this way. Perhaps my esteemed colleagues will find in my brain a trace of the qualities they found missing from the expressions of my intellectual activities while I was living. Whatever happens to the corpse—buried, burned or dissected— its owner belonged to no religion and wishes to be spared a religious ceremony, which probably would be refused anyhow. This is not to show animosity against any individual priest who is human like everybody else and often a good and noble person indeed.#Consummated_suicide
Dear N. I am sorry I had to do this here! It is really more than I can stand— the horror, day after day at the court and in the streets. It is not only fear, it is a wish not to let them get me. I would rather get myself. I do hope I have not let people down too much. I tried to do my stuff but after Marshall’s summing up, I've given up all hope. The car needs oil in the gear-box, by the way. Be happy in it. Incidentally, it was surprisingly easy and required no guts. I am sorry to disappoint the vultures. I only hope this has done the job. Delay resuscitation as long as possible.#Consummated_suicide
My wife and I choose to die in order to escape the shame of overthrow or capitulation. It is our wish for our bodies to be cremated immediately on the place where I have performed the greater part of my daily work during twelve years of service to my people. #Consummated_suicide
To the Allied Control Council: I would have let you shoot me without further ado! But it is not possible to hang the German Reichsmarschall! I cannot permit this, for Germany's sake. Besides, I have no moral obligation to submit to the justice of my enemies. I have therefore chosen the manner of death of the great Hannibal. It was clear from the outset that a death sentence would be pronounced against me, as I have always regarded the trial as a purely political act by the victors, but I wanted to see this trial through for my people’s sake and I did at least expect that I should not be denied a soldier’s death. Before God, my country, and my conscience I feel myself free of the blame that an enemy tribunal has attached to me. #Consummated_suicide
Dear Pastor Gerecke! Forgive me, but I had to do it like this for political reasons. I have prayed long to my God and feel that I am doing the right thing. (I would have let them shoot me.) Please comfort my wife and tell her that this was no ordinary suicide, and that she can rest assured that God will still gather me up in his great mercy! God protect my dearest ones! God bless you, dear pastor, evermore. Your Hermann Göring. #Consummated_suicide
My only sweetheart!  Upon mature consideration and after profound prayers to my God, I have decided to take my own life and thus not allow my enemies to execute me. I would always have accepted death by firing squad. But the Reichsmarschall of Greater Germany can not allow himself to be hanged. Moreover, the killings were to be carried out  like a spectacle with the press and film cameras there (I assume for the newsreel pictures). Sensation is all that matters. I however want to die quietly and out of the public eye. My life came to an end the moment I said my last farewell to you. Since then I am filled with a wondrous peace and I regard death as the final release. I take it as a sign from God that throughout the months of my imprisonment He allowed me the means to free myself from this mortal coil, and that this means was never discovered. In His charity, God thus spared me the bitter end. All my thoughts are with you, with Edda, and all my beloved friends! The last beats of my heart will mark our great and eternal love. Your Hermann #Consummated_suicide
To Whom It May Concern: First, everyone understand: I had nothing to do with Nicole’s murder. I loved her, always have and always will. If we had a problem, it’s because I loved her so much. Unlike what has been written in the press, Nicole and I had a great relationship for most of our lives together. Like all long-term relationships, we had a few downs and ups. I don’t want to belabor knocking the press but I can't believe what is being said. Most of it is totally made up. I know you have a job to do, but as a last wish, please, please, please leave my children in peace. Their lives will be tough enough. I want to send my love and thanks to all my friends—I’m sorry I can't name every one of you—especially A. C. Man, thanks for being in my life. I think of my life and feel I've done most of the right things. So why do I end up like this? I can’t go on. No matter what the outcome, people will look and point. I can’t take that. I'm proud of how I lived. My momma taught me to do unto others. I treated people the way I wanted to be treated. I've always tried to be up and helpful. So why is this happening? I'm sorry for the Goldman family. I know how much it hurts. Nicole and I had a good life together. At times I have felt like a battered husband or boyfriend, but I loved her. Make that clear to everyone . . . Don't feel sorry for me. I've had a great life, great friends, please think of the real O. J. and not this lost person. Thanks for making my life special. I hope I helped yours. Peace and love, O. J. Please, please, please, leave my children in peace.#Consummated_suicide

I have long determined that the best thing I could do was to put an end to the existence of a being whose birth was unfortunate and whose life has only been a series of pains to those persons who have hurt their health in endeavoring to promote her welfare. Perhaps to hear of my death may give you pain, but you will soon have the blessing of forgetting that such a creature ever existed. #Consummated_suicide
I am food for what I am good for—worms. I have made a will here which I desire to be respected, and add the donation of £20 to Dr. Ecklin my physician. W.

Life was too great a bore on one peg and that a bad one. Buy for Dr. Ecklin above mentioned Reade’s best stomach pumps. #Consummated_suicide
Most people end their lives because something sad has happened to them. I end mine because it seems not only futile but wrong to go on existing. I blame no one and feel I have no enemies. I will probably be considered insane as anyone taking his life is supposed to be slightly insane. I would like to send my regards to Miss S. in Drew Seminary. My check for $175 in the suitcase in the closet at home may help pay my burial expenses. I am very happy now. I am wondering if the newspapers will decide to devote any space to me. I am wondering if I will find time to think of the past as I whirl through space as it is said that a drowning man does when struggling in the water. I am wondering if I will find anything in death. If so, what?  Everything has always been discord when I long so for harmony. Maybe yet, I will find it, maybe sweet music. If I find any sort of life or corresponding time after death, I will try to communicate with my immediate relatives at nine o’clock some evening for a while. During my lifetime, I think my one fault was deception. I have lied repeatedly about small things, but unfortunately I forget what these small things were. I have no guilty conscience whatsoever. #Consummated_suicide

For every act there is a cause. In this instance the act is justified, at least, I believe so. The following statement will establish if my contention is right or not. I have been practicing law in this State for thirty years. Have been and still am connected with fraternal and other organizations. I have always received the esteem of my fellow men. For several years I have been mistaken for another party, the reason for which is a similarity of names and by being in the same profession. My full name is Ernest P, and my offices are at 519 Market Street, a lawyer by profession, aged fifty-seven, height five feet seven inches. The other person is younger and six feei in height but  because of his name has been continually mistaken for me. As a fact, even people with whom I am in close contact at the Hall of Justice and the City Hall have often mistaken me for him. A few days ago he was charged with a statutory charge. Under the law I give him the right of presumption of innocence. However, that does not eradicate the fact that since that time I have realized from actions of many people that they seem to be under the impression that I am the one involved. A victim of circumstance, to say the least. Some people even, thoughtlessly joking, have remarked about the charge involving this man. It seems nothing could well be done to establish the fact that I am not involved in that statutory charge. The only way is to give it publicity and I feel the act I am about to do will solve the problem. Personally, I care not. My life has been lived. My family is of the highest moral character and I feel that a stigma would attach unless I let the public at large know, through this deed, that I am a victim of circumstance by reason of mistaken identity. I have been brooding over this matter, and the seriousness of the matter involving this other man makes it mandatory that I, Ernest P., should protect the reputation of my family in the only available and possible manner. Respectfully submitted. #Consummated_suicide
My dearest. I have taken my life in order to provide capital for you. The IRS and its liens which have been taken against our property illegally by a runaway agency of our government have dried up all sources of  credit for us. So I have made the only decision I can. It's purely a business decision. I hope you can understand that. I love you completely . . . You will find my body on the lot on the north side of the house.#Consummated_suicide
We have the means to afford the best doctors, hospitals and around-the-clock home care to the end of our days, but neither of us wants that kind of life. Also it would consume a substantial part of our money, which through our will and through the mission work of our church is destined to help many young people throughout the world who may one day be able to help many more. We have no immediate family or heirs. In a sense, this legacy represents the final purpose of our lives. Goodbye for now. #Consummated_suicide

Lucy, pardonnez-moi.#Consummated_suicide
I’m deeply sorry for you. I spent Christmas Eve alone in this apartment hearing the laughter and joy of neighbors. But it’s impossible to go through it again. On a day like this everyone seeks the company of beloved ones. Here I am with nowhere to spend New Year's in anyone’s company. It’s simply my fault. Forgive me for such a vulgar note. #Consummated_suicide
Dearest, I feel certain I am going mad again. I feel we can’t go through another of those terrible times. And I shan’t recover this time. I begin to hear voices, and I can’t concentrate. So I am doing what seems the best thing to do. You have been in every way all that anyone could be. I don’t think two people could have been happier till this terrible disease came. I can't fight any longer. I know that I am spoiling your life, that without me you could work. And I know you will. You see I can't even write this properly. I can’t read. What I want to say is I owe all the happiness of my life to you. You have been entirely patient with me and incredibly good. I want to say that—everybody knows it. If anybody could have saved me it would have been you. Everything has gone from me but the certainty of your goodness. I can’t go on spoiling your life any longer. I don’t think two people could have been happier than we have been. #Consummated_suicide
This note should be pretty easy to understand. All the wording’s from the Punk Rock 101 . .. I haven't felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music, along with reading and writing for too many years now . .. I've tried everything that’s in my power to appreciate it, and I do. God, believe me, I do . . . I must be one of those narcissists who only appreciate things when they’re alone. I'm too sensitive. I need to be slightly numb in order to regain the enthusiasm I had as a child . . . There’s good in all of us and I simply love people too much. So much that it makes me feel too fucking sad . . . I have it good, very good, and I'm grateful. But, since the age of seven, I've become hateful toward all humans in general...I’m too much of an erratic, moody baby! I don’t have the passion anymore, and so remember, it’s better to burn out than to fade away. Peace, love, empathy, Kurt Cobain #Consummated_suicide
"Heaven knows, my dear and excellent friend, what strange feelings, half sad, half joyful, move us in this hour, as our souls rise above the world like two joyous balloonists, to write to you once more, for actually we had decided not to send our friends and acquaintances cards of leave-taking. It must be because we have thought of you in a thousand happy moments, because we have imagined a thousand times how you with your generous nature would have laughed (exulted) if you had seen us together in the green room. Ah, the world is a strange place! —It seems somehow fitting that Jettchen [Henriette] and I, two gloomy, woebegone people, who have always deplored their own coldness, should have come to love each other with all our hearts, and the best proof of it, I feel, is that we are going to die together. Farewell, our dear, dear friend, and be very happy—it is said to be possible on earth. We for our part wish to know nothing of the joys of this world, we know and dream only of heavenly meadows and suns, in the light of which we shall stroll about with long wings on our shoulders. Adieu! A kiss from me, who am writing this, to Muller; tell him to think of me now and then, and to remain a valiant warrior of God against the diabolical madness that holds the world enchained.— H. v.

"Obit. Every one who knows me and hears of it will have a different hypothesis to offer to explain why I did it. Practically all of these hypotheses will be dramatic and completely wrong. Any sane doctor knows that the reasons for suicide are invariably psychopathological and the true suicide type manufactures his own difficulties. I have had, on the contrary, an exceptionally glamorous life, as life goes; and I have had more than my share of affection and appreciation. The most charming, intelligent and important people I have known have liked me, and the list of my enemies is very flattering to me. I have always had excellent health, but since my early childhood I have suffered from a melancholia, which in the last five years has begun to show definite symptoms of manic-depressive insanity. It has prevented my getting anything like the full value out of my  talent, and the past three years has made work a torture to do at all. It has made it impossible for me to enjoy the simple pleasures of life. I have run from wife to wife, from house to house and from country to country in a ridiculous effort to escape from myself. In doing so, I am very much afraid that I have brought a great deal of unhappiness to those who have loved me. In particular, my remorse is bitter over my failure to appreciate my beautiful lost angel, Carlotta, the only woman I ever loved and whom I respect and admire above all the rest of the human race. She is the one person who could have saved me had I been savable. She did her best. No one ever ever had a more devoted or more understanding wife. I do hope she will understand what my malady was and forgive me a little. No one thing is responsible for this and no one person—except myself. If the gossips insist on something more definite and thrilling as a reason, let them choose my pending appointment with the dentist or the fact that I happen to be painfully short of cash at the moment. No other single reason is more important or less temporary. After all, one has to choose a moment, and the air is always full of reasons at any given moment. I did it because I am fed up with inventing devices for getting through twenty-four hours a day and with bridging over a few months periodically with some beautiful interest, such as a new gal who annoyed me to the point where I forgot my own troubles. I present my remains, with my compliments, to any medical school that fancies them or soap can be made of them. In them I haven't the slightest interest except that I want them to cause as little bother as possible. XXXXXXX I kiss my dear children—and Carlotta. "#Consummated_suicide

Edge The Woman is perfected. Her Dead. Body wears the smile of accomplishment, The illusion of a Greek necessity. Flows in the scrolls of her toga. Her bare. Feet seem to be saying:  We have come so far, it is over. Each dead child coiled, a white serpent, One at each little. Pitcher of milk, now empty. She has folded. Them back into her body as petals. Of a rose close when the garden. Stiffens and odours bleed. From the sweet, deep throats of the night flowers. #Consummated_suicide
"Wanting to Die. Since you ask, most days I cannot remember. I walk in my clothing, unmarked by that voyage. Then the almost unnameable lust returns. Even then I have nothing against life. I know well the grass blades you mention, the furniture you have placed under the sun. But suicides have a special language. Like carpenters they want to know which tools. They never ask why build. Twice I have so simply declared mysely, have possessed the enemy, eaten the enemy, have taken his craft, his magic. In this way, heavy and thoughtful, warmer than oil and water, I have rested, drooling at the mouth-hole. I did not think of my body at needle point. Even the cornea and the leftover urine were gone. Suicides have already betrayed the body. Still-born, they don't always die, but dazzled, they can't forget a dung so sweet that even children would look on and smile. To thrust all that life under your tongue! that, all by itself, becomes a passion. Death’s a sad bone; bruised, you’d say, and yet she waits for me, year after year, to so delicately undo an old wound, to empty my breath from its bad prison. Balanced there, suicides sometimes meet, raging at the fruit, a pumped-up moon, leaving the bread they mistook for a kiss, leaving the page of the book carelessly open, something unsaid, the phone off the hook and the love, whatever it was, an infection."#Consummated_suicide

I made mistakes from ignorance, inexperience and overwork I did not knowingly violate any law or standard of conduct No one in the White House, to my knowledge, violated any law or standard of conduct, including any action in the travel office. There was no intent to benefit any individual or specific group. The FBI lied in their report to the AG [attorney general] The Press is covering up the illegal benefits they received from the travel staff. The GOP has lied and misrepresented its knowledge and role and covered up a prior investigation.

My happiness of '48-49 is paid for in full. Behind that Olympian contentment lay my impotence and my refusal to become involved. Now, in my own way, I have gone down into the abyss: I contemplate my impotence, I feel it in my bones, and I am caught in a political responsibility that is crushing me. There is only one answer: suicide. Dilemma. Should I act in perfect amity, doing it all for her own good, or diabolically explode? A pointless question—already settled by my whole past, by fate: I shall be a diabolical friend, gaining nothing by it—but perhaps I shall have the courage. The courage. Everything will depend on having it at the right moment—when it will do her no harm—but she must know it, she must know it. Can I deny myself that? Certainly, I know more about her than she does about me.#Consummated_suicide

"... Today I see clearly that from '28 until now I have always lived under this shadow . .. even you are only a pretext. The real fault, apart from my own, lies with that “agonizing disquietude, with its secret smile.” I have done my part by the world, as best I could. I have worked; I have given poetry to men, I have shared the sorrows of many. "#Consummated_suicide
Suicides are timid murderers. Masochism instead of sadism. . . . This is the balance sheet of an unfinished year, that I won't finish.#Consummated_suicide
[Pavese’s last entry] The thing most feared in secret always happens. I write: oh Thou, have mercy. And then? All it takes is a little courage. The more the pain grows clear and definite, the more the instinct for life asserts itself and the thought of suicide recedes. It seemed easy when I thought of it. Weak women have done it. It takes humility not pride. All this is sickening. Not words. An act. I won't write anymore.#Consummated_suicide
I forgive everyone and ask forgiveness of everyone. O.K.? Not too much gossip, please.#Consummated_suicide

"I sat from two till five staring at my picture like an idiot. My brain pressed down by anxiety and anxious looks of my dear Mary and children, whom I was compelled to inform. I dined, after having raised money on all our silver, to keep us from want in case of accidents, and Rochfort, the respectable old man in Brewer Street, having expressed great sympathy for my misfortunes, as I saw white locks under his cap, I said, “Rochfort, take off your cap.” He took it off, and showed a fine head of silvery hair. “This is the very thing I  want: come and sit.” He smiled, and looked through me. “When?” “Saturday at nine.” “I will, sir”; and would any man believe, I went home with a lighter heart at having found a model for the hair of the kneeling figure in Alfred? This is as good as anything I remember of Wilkie in my early days. I came home, and sat as I describe. "#Consummated_suicide
"O God, bless me through the evils of this day. Great anxiety. My landlord, Newton, called. I said “I see a quarter's rent in thy face; but none from me.” I appointed to-morrow night to see him, and lay before him every iota of my position. “Good-hearted Newton!” I said, “don’t put in an execution!” “Nothing of the sort,” he replied, half hurt. I sent the Duke, Wordsworth, dear Fred’s and Mary’s heads to Miss Barrett to protect. I have the Duke’s boots and hat, and Lord Grey’s coat, and some more heads."#Consummated_suicide

"No man should use certain evil for probable good, however great the object. Evil is the prerogative of the Deity.I create good, I create, I the Lord do these things. Wellington never used evil if the good was not certain. Napoleon had no such scruples, and I fear the glitter of his genius rather dazzled me; but had I been encouraged nothing but good would have come from me, because when encouraged I paid everybody. God forgive the evil for the sake of the good. Amen."#Consummated_suicide

Terrific smell of gas fumes . . . it would be 6:34 .M. civilian time. It’s getting rather dark to write. Eyes smart a bit . . . Afraid somebody will come by now . . . This is slow (6:36 P.M.) #Consummated_suicide
Engine sounds smooth. Faculties seem temporarily sharpened. Eyes still smart . . . one man objected when I stopped on his property . . . Can't blame him much really . . . #Consummated_suicide
Seems that there are more gas fumes in here than anything else right now . .. muscles used in writing . . . in need of a rest. I'm afraid somebody will come.#Consummated_suicide
Elbows, esp., and wrists. Where is the will? . . . No particular desire to get out . . . seems to be getting the better of me fast. It’s been just 15 minutes now. I wonder what it’s going to be like? Chest filling up fast. Seems to be terrific pressure first.#Consummated_suicide
Waiting. Feeling very happy. First time I ever felt without worry, as if I were free. My heart must be strong. It won't give way. . . . Extraordinary. Pulse running well. Feel fine—when will it be over? . . . God seems to be over me—just leaving for a lovely voyage, but it is slow—first time without worry. #Consummated_suicide
I feel the effects now. The room is going around and around. I can barely see what I am writing. Maybe it is the end. Who knows? I don’t care . . . #Consummated_suicide
This is my last experiment and it is in self-destruction. I believe that it is advisable, if one’s inclinations lead to the anti-social side. I think Spinoza told the world more than Christ did, although Christ’s message was more fundamental. Enticing as personal immortality sounds, I hope for oblivion. The worst they can do for one in this world is to hang you, and if there is any eternal torment worse than mine I'll have to be shown. I don't know if it is of much importance, but I feel that the only method of dying withcut pain is to use carbon monoxide. To get a supply I am passing city gas through concentrated sulphuric acid to delete the mercaptan odor: There is no one that admires Jesus Christ more than I do, although the conventional contemporary method of worshiping him gives me a pain in the neck. P.S.: The question of suicide and selfishness to close friends and relatives is one that I can’t answer or even give an opinion on. It is obvious, however, that I have pondered it and decided I would hurt them less dead than alive. P.P.S.: and the eight balls dreadful, like an outhouse in a fog, looms up to charm its victim, supine in the grip of grog. #Consummated_suicide
"Jones: I've tried my best to give you a good life. In spite of all that I’ve tried, a handful of our people, with their lies, have made our life impossible. There's no way to detach ourself from what’s happened today . . . If we can't live in peace then let’s die in peace. [applause] We've been so betrayed. We have been so terribly betrayed . . . So my opinion is that you be kind to children, and be kind to seniors, and take the potion like they used to take in Ancient Greece, and step over quietly; because we are not committing suicide—it’s a revolutionary act. We can’t go back; they won't leave us alone. They’re now going back to tell more lies, which means more Congressmen. And there’s no way, no way we can survive . . . Well, some, everybody dies. Some place that hope runs out; because everybody dies. I haven't seen anybody yet didn’t die. And I like to choose my own kind of death for a change. I'm tired of being tormented to hell, that’s what I'm tired of. Tired of it. [applause] . . . This is—what I'm talking about now is the dispensation of judgment. This is a revolutionary—a revolutionary suicide council. I'm not talking about self—self-destruction. I'm talking about that we have no other road. . . . Please get us some medication. Simple. It’s simple, there's no convulsions with it. It’s just simple. Just, please get it. Before it’s too late . . . I tell you, get movin’, get movin’, get movin'. Don't be afraid to die. You'll see people land out here. They’ll torture our people. They’ll torture our seniors. We cannot have this . . . Woman: . .. O.K. There’s nothing to worry about. Everybody keep calm; and try and keep your children calm. And all those children that can help, let the little children in and reassure them. They’re not crying from pain; it’s just a little bitter tasting, they’re not crying out of any pain . . . Man: The choice is not ours now. It’s out of our hand ... It feels good, but never felt so good—I tell you. You’ve never felt so good as how that feels . . . Woman: Good to be alive today. I just like to thank Dad [Jim Jones] ‘Cause he was the only one to stand up for me when I need him. I'm glad to be here . . . Woman: I'm glad that you’re my brothers and sisters. I'm glad to be here . . . Jones: Mother, mother, mother, mother, mother please. Mother please. Please, Please. Don’t do this. Don't do this. Lay down your life with your child. But don’t do this. Free at last. Keep—keep your emotions down. Children, it will not hurt. If you'd be—if you’d be quiet. If you be quiet [music and crying] . .. So be patient. Be patient. Death is—I tell you, I don’t care how many screams you hear; I don’t care how many anguished cries, death is a million times preferable to spend more days in this life . . . Let’s be digni—Ilet’s be dignified. If you quit telling them they’re dying—if you would also stop some of this nonsense—adults, adults, I call on you to stop this nonsense. I call on you to quit exciting your children, when all  they’re doing is going to a quiet rest. I call on you to stop this now, if you have any respect at all . . . All they do is taking a drink. They take it to go to sleep. That’s what death is, sleep I'm tired of it all . .. Have trust. You have to step across. We used to think this world was—this world was not our home, and it sure isn’t . . . Take our life from us. We laid it down, we got tired. We didn’t commit suicide, we committed an act of revolutionary suicide protesting the conditions of an inhumane world. [organ music] "#Consummated_suicide
Dad—I see no way out—I agree with your decision—I fear only that without you the world may not make it to communism. For my part—I am more tired of this wretched, merciless planet & the hell it holds for so many masses of beautiful people—thank you for the only life I've known. #Consummated_suicide
I feel disgusted when I see guys who make a fuss about the entrance examination all the time. Rebelling, I have not studied for about two months. I don't think I can pass. I am in bad shape. Therefore, I die, although I would like to enter a first-rate university. I am ashamed of myself, unable to grow out of childishness. I envy others. There should be room for a stupid man like me, too. I would like to see Hell. #Consummated_suicide
Please stay calm. Try to hide my suicide. Please don’t think about causes of my suicide and don't inquire about what I have done before death. For me the present university is nothing. If we go to a university in Japan, it must be Tokyo or Kyoto. Many people attend uninteresting classes for four years and wait for employment. It is just like cows and pigs waiting in a wooden stable to be pulled out to the slaughterhouse. I cannot stand it. I believe in the fairy tale that I may be able to be reborn as a superior human being. Then I will enter Tokyo or Kyoto University, or even Sorbonne or Harvard. #Consummated_suicide
Not fulfilling your dream or hope, I am determined to kill myself. I cannot help dying with contempt for myself as the scum of society and an ungrateful coward. My mother’s incessant but miserable efforts . . . all were beyond what I deserved. I don’t know how to apologize to my mother. When I think of my hardworking mother, laboring without rest, I cannot die despite myself. I even think I should take her with me. For about two years, this kind of thought haunted my mind. #Consummated_suicide
... I have no will of my own. From now on, I cannot escape from the agony. Since I began feeling other people’s minds, I have come to feel even more miserable. I may look human from the outside, but my inside is empty, stupid, dull-witted and self-isolating. What on earth is in me? I may be breathing, thanks to the support of parents and other people around me, but my real self is like a lifeless doll. #Consummated_suicide
This is a demonstration of resistance to present-day Japan by a person who has wriggled for twenty-five years at the bottom of this society, because of his Korean ancestry.#Consummated_suicide
"I thank you for the favor you have given me just because I am from the same prefecture as you. I have regarded you as a god. Since the revelation of this incident, you have given me kind support. I am thankful for it and I feel sorry that I gave you much trouble. You told me to be patient and endure . .. Please laugh at me who could not be courageous enough to endure. I saw many wrongdoings by the president and the director, and I thought “just this much will be all right.” Then I found myself the whipping boy, as reported in newspapers and on television. I feel something is wrong. I have been framed; I am the victim. I cannot forgive the president and the director. They led me to destroy the proof of their misdeeds, and still they behave as if they have nothing to do with me. I cannot but feel angry. You have told me not to have rancor against others, but the fact is that the director bought jewelry, art, antiques, and paintings from the department store. Why am I alone to be picked out? I have worked hard in the matter of gift giving to outsiders. I took upon myself much trouble just for my company. And now I am the one who is blamed for everything. After all, I was stupid to be used, because I worked hard to adjust myself to the atmosphere in the president’s room under the direction of the director. Please laugh at me. May I take the liberty of asking your favor for my family members? "#Consummated_suicide
... We humans are animals, and all animals are afraid of death. What we call life energy is animal energy. But my being tired of eating and having sex must mean I am losing animal energy. The world I am living in now is the icily transparent universe of sickly nerves. I spent last night with a prostitute, talking about her wage. The talk made me realize the misery of human beings, struggling just to live. If we can enter eternal sleep, we may at least have peace, even if we may not enjoy happiness. However, I am doubtful about when I can dare to take my own life. Under conditions like these, Nature herself looks more beautiful to me than ever. You may laugh at the contradiction between the love of Nature and the wish for suicide. However, Nature looks even more beautiful exactly because I am at the end of my life. This gives me satisfaction even in a life which has been a series of sufferings. Please do not publish this letter for several years after my death. I may end my life in such a way that it appears to be death from illness . . . Of course, I do not want to die, but it is suffering to live. People may laugh at me for committing suicide when I have parents, a wife and children. If I were alone, I would not have committed suicide. My wish to commit suicide now is probably the only willful act in my  life. I have had many dreams, as all young people do, but thinking back, I might, after all, just have been an odd person. At present I dislike everything, including myself. #Consummated_suicide
The nation has no spiritual foundation. That is why you don't agree with me! You don’t understand Japan. The Jieitai must put things right. . .. Listen . . . be quiet will you . . . Don’t you hear . . . Just listen to me! What happened last year? On October 21? There was a demonstration, an antiwar demonstration. On October 21 last year. In Shinjuku. And the police put it down. The police! After that there was, and there will be, no chance to amend the Constitution. Listen! Listen! Listen! Listen! A man appeals to you! A man! I am staking my life on this! Do you hear? Do you follow me? If you do not rise with me, if the Jieitai will not rise, the Constitution will never be amended! You will be just American mercenaries. American troops! I have waited for four years! Yes, four years! I wanted the Jieitai to rise! Four years! I have come to the last thirty minutes. Yes, the last thirty minutes. I am waiting . . . Are you men? You are soldiers! Then why do you stand by the constitution? You back the constitution that denies your very existence. Then you have no future! You will never be saved! It is the end. The Constitution will remain forever. You are finished. You are unconstitutional! Listen! You are unconstitutional. The Jieitai is unconstitutional! You are all unconstitutional! Don't you understand? Will any of you rise with me? You will not rise. You will do nothing. The constitution means nothing to you. You are not interested. I have lost my dream of the Jieitai!

To Everyone.The fact that I die is no one’s fault and, please, don’t gossip. The deceased especially hate that. Mama, sisters and comrades, forgive me—it’s not the best way (I don’t recommend it to others), but I have no other exit. Lilia—love me. My Comrade Government, my family is Lilia Brik, my mother, my sisters, and Veronica Vitoldovna Polonskaya. If you can arrange a tolerable life for them—thanks. Give my poems in progress to the Brik family, they will take care of them. As they say— “the final juicy incident is closed” my beloved boat is broken on the rocks of daily life. I've paid my debts and no longer need to count pains I've suffered at the hands of others The misfortunes and the insults. Good luck to those who remain Viadimir Mayakovsky. P.S.

The time is approaching when we shall consider it abhorrent to our civilization to allow a human being to die in prolonged agony which we should mercifully end in any other creature. Believing this choice to be of social service in promoting wiser views on this question, I have preferred Chloroform to cancer. #Consummated_suicide

After three and one half years I find I can no longer go on with this pain and agony. I have not been out of the house in three years except to go to Detroit to see my doctor. I don't call this living. . . . I'm so glad there is a Dr. Kevorkian to help me. . . . If God won't come to me I’m going to go to God. #Consummated_suicide
... My reasons for deciding to put an end to my life are simple and compelling: Parkinson's Disease and the slow-killing variety of leukemia (CCL) . . . I wish my friends to know that I am leaving their company in a peaceful frame of mind, with some timid hopes for a depersonalized after-life beyond due confines of space, time and matter and beyond the limits of our comprehension. This “oceanic feeling” has often sustained me at difficult moments, and does so now, while I am writing this. What makes it nevertheless hard to take this final step is the reflection of the pain it is bound to inflict on my few surviving friends, and above all my wife Cynthia . . . #Consummated_suicide

To San Francisco Police Department—or equivalent Jurisdiction. This is to state that I, Ron R. Berst (Mother’s maiden name is Swinburne), did take my own life, due to the fact that I have the disease AIDS, and it has progressed both rapidly, and to the point where: 1) How ill I constantly feel and have almost no energy, and: 2) I very soon expect to become a burden to my friends and family, and I do not want to put any of them through such an ordeal. Further, I want to be remembered as a fairly active, vibrant, caring, individual—how people perceive of me now, not the bedridden, sickly, forgetful person that I can see myself starting a path towards becoming . . I sincerely regret any inconvenience that this may have caused anyone involved. I honestly believe that a fast end such as this— while one is still able—yet ill enough to justify it, is easier on my  close friends, who have been so unbelievably supportive emotionally for me, and my family, who have been no less so, than to drag this out. I did NOT “give up.” With AIDS, as you know it is fairly downhill—without much (any) hope for a reversal. This way I am remembered the way I WANT to be remembered—and my friends can go on with their lives, and perhaps the dollars saved in not having to “drag my survival out to the end” can perhaps be better spent or applied to finding a cure for this disease, so my friends may not have to go through what I have.#Consummated_suicide
By the time you read these lines I WILL HAVE GENTLY ENDED my life on the date of this letter’s postmark. More than a decade ago I concluded that suicide need not be pathological. Further, that rational suicide makes possible a truly ideal closing of one’s life span. Commitment to a rational suicide spares one erosive accelerating investment against unwanted existence. More important by far than such practical avoidance, however, is the paradoxical life-enriching value of suicide. Life perspectives clouded by the vagaries and fears of open-endedness become crystal clear. ... I decided I would set an exit date and prepare to meet it. I'd aim for my exit date to predate discomfort of intensity which might diminish my chance of CREATING ON MY OWN TERMS THE FINAL STROKE OF MY LIFE’S CANVAS. No treasure of my life—and there are many!—is greater than the growth emerging from the approach to my death. I can say, however, that I believe time is at hand when consciousness of personal responsibility for the length of one’s life span—as well as for its content—will establish RATIONAL SUICIDE AS A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT TO BE GIVEN SOCIETY’S ASSISTANCE AND PROTECTION. The difference between killing oneself and bringing one's life to a responsible good end is the very real difference between pathological and rational suicide. I urge each of you to begin as early as possible— I HOPE YOU WILL WORK TO SHAPE YOUR OWN LIFE AND TO CREATE A GOOD END TO DIGNIFY IT. THEN, LET PEACE WASH OVER YOU TOO! #Consummated_suicide
