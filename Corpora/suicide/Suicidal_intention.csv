Nobody can help me. At this point I just want the suffering to stop. Everything I do is not enough. I feel horrible and suffocating in my own thoughts every day. How disgusting I am, how unlovable I am, how unworthy. I can't do this any longer. This is simply not enough to justify existing#Suicidal_intention
i’ve been thinking about killing my self for more than five years now, i’ve tried last week but stopped myself. i wanna die but at the same time i don’t, but i wanna have a failed suicide attempt so i can bring attention of how much i’m hurting, i feel guilty for wanting this but i wanna know if anyone else has had this idea or thought i guess.#Suicidal_intention
Carbon monoxide poisoning. The people who find my body will be sad forever and I don't mind. I don't want help, I hate you all, and I hope that a lot of people get really upset.#Suicidal_intention
Hello. I've finally got a plan on how i can kill myself and after thinking it over i'm pretty sure this will work. I plan on doing it next week and i'm excited to finally move on from this worthless existence. These past years have shit and i hope I don't get cold feet. #Suicidal_intention
I tried to hang myself yesterday. Tied a scarf to the top part of my door hinge that sticks out, climbed on a chair, tied the scarf round my neck, and stepped off. All I remember is about two seconds of, wow, this hurts, then I blacked out. Next thing I remember, was a bunch of voices talking and chattering, and suddenly I was awake, in a lot of pain, in the exact same position. I started crying instantly from shock, and managed to climb onto the chair - I still wanted to die but I couldn’t bare the pain. At first I thought this all happened in a few seconds, but when I checked my clock I found out it was actually at least five - seven minutes, which shocked me. I still have a massive mark on my neck from the scarf, and I’m convinced that I would’ve died if the knot had been a bit tighter. I haven’t told anyone this which is why I’m posting it here. I’m probably going to try again soon but I am scared of the pain as, whilst it was quick, it hurt. EDIT - a lot of people are asking why I feel this way, so in summary - I’m still recovering from a breakup that I can’t get over, whilst the other person is absolutely fine. My uni work is piling up but due to depression and anxiety from the breakup, I can’t do it. Everything is going wrong, everyone hates me and I can’t move on from the love of my life, whilst he’s fine.#Suicidal_intention
I don't deserve to be happy, not to be safe, not to be loved. Everyone's life will be better without me i just make everyone's life horrible with my bullshit. I'll most likely be dead within a few days so don't come looking for me. I love you all but i don't deserve anyones love. I'm sorry. I don't mean to hurt anyone but I know that the longer I stay in this wo4ld the more I will hurt people with my bullshit. Im worthless, I have no reason to be here. All I do is cause pain to others and fuck up everyone else's plans. If I'm not here I can't any more. Im a queer depressive, suicidal waste of space. I can't even write a letter right to j won't be able to live right. Just tell me to fuck off and I will, because God I deserve to fuck off.#Suicidal_intention
I always knew it would come to this I was chronically ill then homeless now I’m going to kill myself cause there’s no way out and earth is populated by evil devils. I’m going to jump and have no one to say goodbye too I have no friend or love. I’m going to die tonight goodbye#Suicidal_intention
I can’t do this anymore. I can’t. It’s been too shitty. Suicide isn’t selfish. Suicide isn’t a crime. Suicide isn’t bad. Suicide IS AN OPTION for me. I’m tired of this shit life. I’m so done. Fuck it. Probably will take 180 25mg of. Benadryl tonight. There’s no point#Suicidal_intention
i don't want to suffer anymore. i'm going to put my gun in my mouth and pull the trigger. and no one cares. everyone hates me. i'm disgusting and miserable. and i hate them too. i wish i could delete the fucking universe. fuck you reality. i have no friends. i have nothing. every time someone tries to like me (which is never) i force them to regret the idea. fuck everything. people are so fucking evil.#Suicidal_intention
when i have a problem to face i start planning my death so the problem won't have that much control over me. i don't think it's healthy but I can't stop.#Suicidal_intention
"if you’re reading this, it probably means i’m dead. first things first, from the bottom of my heart i’m so fucking sorry it had to end this way, i hope you guys don’t hate me...i know you guys will resent me at the very least and i honestly can’t blame you. i really think there’s nothing in this letter that will make you feel better about this whole situation but the least i can do is explain my thought process, and maybe let y’all know it’s not what you guys think it’s about. i’m probably gonna fuck up yours guys’ lives, but please know i’m finally getting my rest. i feel so terrible knowing it’ll be at the cost of your guys mental health and i’ll essentially be robbing you of all future happiness. just know it’s literally none of your guys fault and i can say that with 100 confidence. no matter our relationship, i truly appreciate all of you for being in my life. there’s nothing you could’ve done different for me to not kill myself, and it sounds terrible even writing that but i mean it the way that i’ve always felt like my suicide was inevitable. i’ve always felt that the life cycle of work, eat, sleep w occasional pleasures was dumb asf and in my biased opinion one of the ways to escape that meaningless cycle is to not live at all. and you might wonder why not just live the already short life and enjoy what time i have left in this world with those i cherish and love. well. my brain is fucked up and it tells me that it’s not really worth all the effort. fucked up i know, because you guys ARE worth that effort to live my best life, and if i’m being honest family and friends was the only reason i even lived this long in the first place. but once i detach myself from these human feelings, and see life for what it really is, i see the logic in my thinking which you might say is just my depression is talking, which i’m sure it is in a way. but i’m sure you guys can see where i’m coming from. also unfortunately i don’t believe there is anything after death either, just eternal nothingness, which honestly doesn’t sound too bad but it truly does suck because this was my one and only shot of living life and somehow i’ve repeatedly picked the short end of the stick. and i understand that once i kill myself that all my memories, my personality, and everything that makes me, me, will be gone forever. but who wants to be remembered forever? i really did enjoy all my good moments with you guys, and it breaks my heart that i won’t be able to create more memories with y’all. i wish i had more time to really appreciate what i do have in life. but something deep in the very essence of my soul tells me i should give up on my hopes and dreams and stop giving into this depressing meaningless cycle. i tried to fight this feeling at first but i eventually learned that this is who i truly am. i will always be this selfish, lazy, annoying, fucked up person at heart, and it’s only so obvious when it’s pushing me to suicide. can’t you see that the fact that i’m even putting the debt of suicide on your shoulders, that i’m not someone who should be loved and cherished? i am a terrible person and now i’m sure you can see why. im not mad at anyone. i’m only mad at this world, i hate it for making me exist. i hate that i’m this person. i hate that i deal with these thoughts. i guess i could say that i’m also angry at myself. i’m angry for letting it get this way, i’m angry that i’ve been helped so many times only for me to fall down again due to my own stupidity. i’m angry that i let these thoughts override myself. i’m just always so full of this inescapable hatred, i think this is who i am. and honestly at this point i don’t want to try anymore, i’m tired of it all. even just existing to me is exhausting. there is so many things wrong with me mentally, that if any of you truly knew who i was, you would despise me. like the fact that i had to have conversations with multiple people like family & friends, knowing that one day i would stain your minds with my suicide. it’s such a heavy burden to carry and maybe that’s why i feel like i couldn’t talk to anyone about it, because you wouldn’t be able to relate to this feeling of existential isolation. i feel so detached from everyone with these thoughts. how could you truly understand the position i’m in. even with this novel of my thoughts, i still couldn’t expect you to understand. because sometimes these thoughts and feelings can’t be translated, it almost feels abstract. sometimes even i have a hard time examining these thoughts and understanding why i was the one doomed to feel this way. but it’s life, and life is unfair. it really fucking is. i want to grow old with y’all, but growing old is something i never want. it’s such a predicament to be in. no one understands this feeling, not even me. i feel lost in these emotions, i feel like i’m drowning in these emotions. i can’t wait for the suffering to end, and that’s why i want you to understand where i’m coming from. i’m not killing myself for no reason, i’m killing myself to free myself of this pain and suffering even if that means freeing myself of everything that is dear to me. the crazy thing is, i couldn’t give less fucks about my own life, but i want to see you guys prosper and succeed, something that i could never do. it’s ironic to me that i wish for nothing but the best for yall, yet i’m about to deliver nothing but the worst. something no person should have to go through. it’s not like i can expect you guys to forgive me or even accept my apology, because no amount of i’m sorry will ever fix this. even tho i’m like 99% sure there is no after life, i pray to the universe that there’s something that allows us to be together after this physical life. in a way there is; the energy that created me and you, and made me who i am and made you who you are, will return back to the universe and continue to persist until the very heat death of the universe and eventual tear in space time from the infinite expansion of the universe itself. for just a brief moment, the universe got to experience itself through me, and hated it so much it decided to go back to its neutral state. i’m sorry in my final moments i couldn’t even muster the courage to reach out and talk about my feelings to any of you. my heart feels so heavy because there’s so much i want to say, i want to cry in your shoulders and for you to tell me everything will be alright but i know deep down, everything won’t be alright. you guys don’t deserve this, you don’t deserve to get your lives shattered, you guys don’t deserve any of the bad things that have happened in your life. i don’t deserve y’all. and that’s why i straight up hate life, it’s so bullshit. there’s so much i want to say individually to you guys, but in a way i feel that’ll make everything worse. in a way i’m trying to push you guys away so this isn’t so difficult for me. i’m trying to detach myself from these feelings so that i stop procrastinating my death."#Suicidal_intention
There are so many options available to do it but statistically, most of them end up being failed attempts. I don't want to survive suicide, especially in a way other people find out. I'm already a massive disappointment. Surviving suicide has a clear chance of disappointing the few remaining people in the world who don't dislike me.#Suicidal_intention
I told them I was depressed and they took away my PS4. ??? I almost came close to ending it all on Friday but thinking about this one game I need to still play kept me alive. And that's all gone now. I know this sounds sad but I don't care anymore. I genuinely just wanna die so bad and I don't care what others will think about me and whether I hurt their feelings or not. Why was I born? Why isn't it socially acceptable to go to a hospital and be given a fatal pill for the people who don't wanna live? Just let those who want to live live, and those who want to die die.#Suicidal_intention
I want nothing more than to die currently but I also don’t have any plans on actually killing myself - the only reason being that it would wreck all my family and friends. But if I went out by getting hit by a car or something I wouldn’t mind that.#Suicidal_intention
"Like the title says, I started my note today. I'm just so sick of everything. And I know everyone is gonna be in the comments all like ""dont kill yourself you have so much to live for"" but you'd be wrong I dont have anything worth living for and my mind is pretty much made up"#Suicidal_intention
Although I have no current plans to kill myself, however, I can't stop fantasizing about suicide when things go wrong, and it brings me comfort knowing there is a way out. I wish they were some way of turning the part of my brain that reminds me how worthless I am and how nobody cares about me and that I'm better off dead.#Suicidal_intention
I mean I'm 25, 5 years ago I wanted to die, 10 years ago I wanted to die. As far as I can remember I've always been sad, I mean sure there's been times I've been happy but right after they end I'm just sad again. I've always been the outcast, I've always been either ignored or bullied, and I've always been really lonely. I've always hated myself and I'm never good enough. I just don't belong here and that's a permanent problem with no solution. I hate myself, I hate my body, I hate my life and I really hate myself. No one will ever like me, I suck at everything so why can't I just die? It's a permanent solution to a permanent problem and it's the only one I've got.... I'm way too broken to be fixed anyways...... I just wanna stop hurting all the time#Suicidal_intention
I don’t have an active plan to commit but I feel like I wrote as a “just in case things get to hard and I cant even write a note to say goodbye” note. In it i wrote about how I hate my mom even though she has never done anything genuinely bad to me. I said goodbye to best friend and how I’m sorry about things that I’ve done. It made me feel better honestly. I don’t actively seek death but i don’t think I’d be upset if it somehow found me. I’m just tired of no one helping me anymore but at the same time I don’t want help. I feel like I’m romanticizing suicide. I kinda want to try and then survive to just prove how bad it’s gotten. the afterlife scares me. I’m an atheist and believe that it’s like when you fall asleep but you don’t dream. You exist but you don’t. Of course if I actually die I can’t regret anything. sorry this got random. thank you for reading#Suicidal_intention
I drank one bottle of vodka and took 20 pills of valproate. I told my parents and they made me throw up the pills. I feel like such a failure. I shouldn't have told them. I was going to drink more alcohol and go to sleep hoping I'd get respiratory failure and then die. I was also going to take all my benzos but my father hides them because of another suicide attempt I had a few years ago. I feel helpless, hopeless, empty, lonely. I really wish I'd never wake up again.#Suicidal_intention
I am not sad. I didnt cry. There are no tears on the thin paper. Just the small writing everywhere and a dandelion I drew in one corner. There is no future for me. Being trans is so hard and I dont know who I am anymore. Its to hard to find out and being dead seems to be so peaceful. I did some shit in the past and said some wrong things. If there is hell, I will go there. I dont care. They cant do anything I havent already done to myself. It is probably better when I die. My family will cry a few tears, but they will have to move on. And my friends? They kind of gave up talking to me. You are just a stranger on the internet. You wont remember this post in a few days. History wont remember me. And I like that. I didnt do anything big and never will. I am just a teenager. Soon a dead one.#Suicidal_intention
I find it as a comforting thing to know that I won’t be around for long enough to see things get worse. The thought of taking a load of pills makes me happy#Suicidal_intention
sundays are the fucking worst. I’m forced to spend all day at home with my family that is pretty much the number one reason I’m suicidal. I fucking hate them. I never go out because I have zero friends. everything is so fucking aggravating. my anger issues are so much worse than the rest of the week. my self esteem is always at a 0. I have ZERO motivation to do anything. even my favorite music starts to sound fucking awful. all I have left to do is cry, wish I was dead, self harm and sleep. usually when I feel like this I just go to sleep so I can’t feel anything, but I don’t even have any sleeping pills so fuck me.#Suicidal_intention
My life has been steadily going down the tube since I was 7 years old - I'm 21M. It's seldom improved. On the events it has, it was quickly followed by something dramatically worse. Example - got my first car. Within two weeks, learned my first serious girlfriend had been cheating for more than half our relationship, and lost my job. This is a consistent pattern. My profile is extremely telling for anyone that wants details. I've retold all of it multiple times. It's open to the curious. But, it's all resulted in a decision. August 16, 2021 will be my last day on this Earth if I don't get some reason to live. I'm trying to improve myself. Physical training and nominally useless therapy. I intend to keep at it. Life has 124 days to prove it's worth all this suffering. And I have 124 days to figure out the details. Probably going to cut my wrists. But, I need to figure out how I'm going to do it. Hoe to stop my mother from killing herself after. Stop some innocent passerby from finding my body. All things that need considering.#Suicidal_intention
I’ve never written one because I have nobody to write it to so this may be shit. I don’t wanna kill myself I really truly don’t. But I just physically and mentally refuse to continue I know it’s not the right way and I know I shouldn’t but I have no other option. I’ve tried to kill myself before 21 times actually I just can’t keep fighting anymore. I don’t know what to do except kill myself I have nothing to live for and have to kill myself I have to I have no option. My parents abused me badly well I never met my father my my mother would do things that are horrible. my stepfather well if I spoke I would literally be punched imagine being a grown fucking man and breaking a 6 year olds nose for speaking or stepping out of his room or some shit. I have bipolar disorder and lash out and breakdown. Suicide is my only option. Within a week I’m going to kill myself I’m aware I’m to young (23) but I don’t care I’ve lived a lifetime of bullshit already. I just want it to end I can’t endure anymore I’m at my breaking point. I’m pathetic I’m a grown man sitting here crying about to kill myself. I can’t continue any longer thanks for reading and sorry for wasting your time I’m not looking to be talked out of it bye hopefully my last post. #Suicidal_intention
"People always say ""I'm here to listen if you need to talk"", but then behind your back get tired of you for venting all the time. No one really cares about you. Your life isn't going anywhere. You have no life skills. That's how I feel and why I want to kill myself. I've had a shitty childhood, a shitty adult life and never had money to enjoy my life. Life is made for the 1% to thrive and for you to make sure they do. Fuck living. Fuck the world. And fuck myself. I'm a low life trash piece of shit and that's how it will be unless I end myself."#Suicidal_intention
Especially before falling asleep. I quit doing it for a little while but im doing it again and its comforting. My life is a trainwreck. I have a mentally abusive father, currently screaming at my mom. Hes been doing it for about an hour now. I hate the fact that i still love him even tho he's always been like this. Or maybe i dont, maybe if he wasnt my father i would hate him. I hate the daddy issues. I hate how I found myself an older man to love and i call him daddy and thats comforting too. I want someone to love me but my dad and my mentally abusive ex ruined me. I cant trust anyone completely. I hate myself. I can only trust my dogs. One of them died last week. My sweet little baby, my childhood friend crossed the rainbow bridge very unexpectedly. University is stressing me out too. Its all too much. Ive had enough. And I just cant do it. I cant kill myself. Im not brave enough. But sometimes i already feel like im not even here.#Suicidal_intention
So I'm going to kill myself with carbon monoxide poisoning. I just bought the charcoal. I'm going to get drunk beforehand, and well, the rest is easy.#Suicidal_intention
Telling people, ain't worth it. It's not like they aren't still going to judge you if you do kill yourself. They don't understand the pain. Please just allow me to die!#Suicidal_intention
I am confused why am I like this. I was suicidal few months back. I wanted to do something to end my life and couldn’t. Few days later I felt I did the right thing. But now again, I feel the same way I felt few months ago. I am tired of waiting for things to change. I am not a good person I believe. I was once. But not anymore. I stooped to a low point of no return and bearing it’s weight now. My existence is becoming a burden for others. I don’t seek to hurt others, but yet I do somehow. My head is bursting with stress as I type. Blood gushing. I wish I get a hemorrhage and die. I wish I get cancer and die. Because I am pussy to not able to take that step to do it myself. But I want to end this.#Suicidal_intention
I'm having a rough go of it right now, my mom was getting better with her alcoholism but is falling back hard (10 drinks within the last two months versus two in four months when she was starting) and it's taking a toll on me. These last five days (her last relapse was Wednesday) I just lost it on her and I've been seething over something or another the past few days, and when I get that bad I start to think about ending it. This time I just, everything I thought I could write was hate. Mom ruined my life, my dad can go fuck himself, my stepdad let me down when I trusted him, my sister is being lied to by our mom over her sobriety, I'd call my mom's sponsor to say my mom lies to her too. Everyone I could think of I just wanted to hurt as I died. I don't know if I actually believe it. I think about death a lot but I've never really wanted to do it, I don't think I can go through with it, but I think about it more than a person should, and I know I think of it as a release. I have to keep going or else I'm going to die, that's about it I guess. I'm talking to a counselor about coping mechanisms (she's teaching me about mindfulness, recognizing what I can do when I'm having trouble coping in a healthy manner) on Wednesday. I'm not in danger or anything. I just thought all this stuff about my family and started panicking in horror, and I needed to get it out of my head and say it to someone before it got stuffed back in and let out at another time. I'm so filled with anger right now, I'm so fragile and ready to burst.#Suicidal_intention
Sometimes I'm super aware of myself I feel suicide is way to free yourself from the chains of reality.#Suicidal_intention
Inside of me is turmoil. Inside of me is a broken soul. Inside of me is someone suffering, and who wants a way out. Just before sleep are my ideations the worst. I have no phone or device to distract me. I try playing mind games and using mental methods to quiet my internal battle, but nothing works. At night, as I lay in bed, I am forced to confront my pain. I often times break into sobbing and weeping and panic. I can't remember the last time I've gone to sleep wanting to wake up in the morning. When I cut my arms and slash my wrists, I distract myself from my internal emotional pain for just a moment. My thoughts are instead on the physical pain I've inflicted upon myself. Only then can I rest without turmoil. My wrists are bloody and I've downed a handful of pills. I don't want to see tomorrow's sun. I don't want to see my story through. I'm exhausted. I'm so tired. I just want a way out. I hate myself so much. I'm tired of persisting. I'm tired of trying. I surrender. I give up. I choose to give up.#Suicidal_intention
I never would’ve thought I’d come this close to ending it all but here I am#Suicidal_intention
I want to stop feeling this way. I heard that writing a suicide note fills you with regret and you end up changing your mind. I wrote a really long goodbye note. I felt no regret, only satisfaction. I was scared. I decided to write a suicide note for each and every one of my friends. Surely one of them would make me regret it. Nope. Only peace. I felt happy that I was committing to this decision. I felt happy that I was taking more steps to ending my suffering. I'll be on Friend 9 soon. I plan to write notes for 32 of my friends and some more for family. I want to regret it. I really want to regret this decision. Hopefully one of these notes does that. If not- well then at least I have my notes ready#Suicidal_intention
As I write it, should these feelings not pass and my intent to end my life does not fade, I cannot ignore the giant fucking irony that I feel more like myself writing this than I have felt in years. In the span of less than an hour I have written more passionately, more sincerely than any interest I claimed to care about.#Suicidal_intention
i've been pretty depressed for about two years now. when ever i'm stressed, anxious or feel pressure - i always think of running away or dying. Last year, i would drive on the highway at night. if no one was around, i would go full speed and close my eyes for a few seconds. i think i was trying to get in an accident, idk. i don't do that anymore, but when i was driving home last night i was thinking about not returning and death. when i got home and was in bed, i was cried myself to sleep thinking about my life and the people in it... and feeling worthless and like a bad person. i don't cause physical harm to myself, but there was a point where i would purposely bang into things or punch myself. it never got to a point of bruising or scarring and was only for about a month. I'm on anti-depressants now... but i still feel depressed and being dead seems nice.#Suicidal_intention
I don't come from a bad home. I'm not bullied at school. I haven't experienced any major losses. Why do I want to die? I feel ashamed that I don't have a valid reason because so many other people have had such bad lives... I feel like I am being disrespectful to those who took their lives for these reasons. What is wrong with me? Why do I want to die?#Suicidal_intention
Is it just me or does thinking of suicide really calm you down. Yesterday my anxiety was really bad and while laying in bed I thought about hanging myself and it felt very peaceful. Luckily or unluckily most of the time I have so little energy to follow through with it. At least for me, I feel like sleep is a great substitute for suicide at least for right now. This leads me to sleep more than 12 hours a day, which is probably not healthy, but yes. #Suicidal_intention
It seems that I've fulfilled all that life has to offer. None of the things I was passionate about seem to entertain me anymore, and I can't find myself feeling anything, even the negatives. I'm not sad, and I'm not scared. I just wonder where everything went. None of it feels really real anymore. It's like I'm waiting for something, but I know how everything in my life will go already. The only thing I can really consider new to me is death, a concept which is the only thing that seems to excite me. I've grown rather tired of this lack of feelings. I'm not even sure when it happened, in all fairness.#Suicidal_intention
Basically, nothing has changed since, except for the fact I'm now almost 24 years old and I have changed a job for a better pay. Still, I tried meeting some other people and also tried online dating apps. These failed miserably. Girls are there just to boost their ego and their IG followers counter. That's how it works in Italy. I only managed to encounter a girl. We talked for two hours, more or less. At the end, obviously she didn't want to give me her phone number. So, I have just made a deal with the world: if this situation doesn't change, then I would commit suicide on August 29th 2021. Why this date? Because it's my birthday. If I pass another shi**t summer, then I will commit suicide on that date.#Suicidal_intention
I'm a 31 year old male. If everything goes as planned, I'll be dead this sunday between 2 3 in the morning. I feel like it's for the best. Society want's me dead for the greater good. I'm terrible at being human. I don't act human, or think human so what am I? I'm something society despises. I'm trying to explain it to family, friends but they just panic al little. I'm telling my doctors and they just give me meds. They also give me diagnosis after diagnosis: depressed, schizofrenic, bipolar, It's like they don't want to listen to reason. So i need to die not only for myself but also to help society by removing myself.I don't know if I make any sense here, it's really hard to explain.#Suicidal_intention
I'm pretty sure suicide is painless if I already have so much pain in my life suicide would hurt less than my other problems. And whats the point of me in life, theres always gonna be someone to replace me in my job and no one gives a shit about me, so whats the point? Life isn't fair so why cant I cheat life and die, ending my pain.#Suicidal_intention
"Here's my second suicide note. Feel free to skip it, it's not fun to read. I wrote it last night. I can't do this anymore. I'm sorry I'm such a fuck up and failure. I'm sorry I can't do anything right, even kill myself. I've tried six times, all within eight days too. I just want it to stop. Please make it stop. I can't keep doing this. I just want to be okay, is that really too much to ask? All I want is to not hate life, and maybe actually enjoy it. It seems impossible, and it probably is. I just want to feel better, but it seems death is the only way to achieve that. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I wasn't more. I'm sorry I'm not good enough. I'm sorry I'm a failure. I'm sorry I always ruin everything. I'm sorry I can't be better. I'm sorry I let you down. I didn't mean to. I assure you, all I want is to be enough, but I'm not, and I never will be. I feel like I'm drowning in the world and when anyone notices I'm drowning I manage to stay afloat just enough to convince them I'm okay while I'm dying more and more inside each day. I can't stop picturing myself doing all of these horrible things to myself, like slicing down a vein and bleeding out, or sawing into my arm, blending my hand, or carving a grin into my face, that sort of thing. It's so horrible. I can't take it. I can't keep living like this. I don't want to die, in fact, the thought of death is absolutely terrifying to me, but it's the only way out so if that's what I've got do do, I'll do it. I can't go on like this. It's like life is the enemy. Just living has become such a difficult task, and I can't keep doing it. It feels impossible. I just want to be okay. Why is that so hard to achieve? When someone asks ""are you okay"" I want to be able to say ""yeah"" and actually mean it. I can't remember the last time I ment it when I said I was okay. I want to mean it, I just don't. I can't. But I'm still so scared to tell anyone about any of this. What If they hate me for it? What if they judge me? What if they dislike me even more than they already do? What if they never talk to me again? What if I become even more alone than I already am? What if everyone leaves me to kill myself but none of my attempts work and I live a long, miserable life? What if I live like this forever? Or at least until I die of accidental causes? That could be years from now. What if nothing ever changes? I'm sorry, I just can't do it anymore. Goodbye."#Suicidal_intention
If I end up dead by the end of this year, it’s because I tried to find professional help and there was no one to help. Hotlines are shitty, no one is accepting new patients, and in order for me to get help, I have to have a substance abuse problem. Am I the only one struggling to find help?#Suicidal_intention
I’m just curious where everyone’s at on this one: I just had a pretty expensive first suicide attempt fail.  I'm three weeks out on it and still don’t honestly regret it- just how and where I did it and that so many people were hurt. I’m just sick of living for other people. People that are advocates for suicide prevention always say that shit that people that jump and have survived immediately regret jumping.. after my car crashed and I woke up and realized I was going to be ok the only thing I felt was just pissed- my foot was still stuck down on the gas after the impact so even when I could have used the brakes before the impact- I didn’t so I know I didn’t regret it at all during or after it.#Suicidal_intention
All I need to do is gather the supplies for this, and then I'm done. I've been waiting so long for this, and I feel so relieved and relaxed. The tightness in my body feels like it has left. Honestly best I've felt in so long. I was having breakdowns earlier, but now I'm just so good. Alright so now I just need to gather supplies and then these messages will be the last thing for me.#Suicidal_intention
Does anyone else seek comfort in the notion that if for whatever reason things get too difficult, all you have to do is kill yourself and the problems go away? For others, unfortunately not so much. I wish that weren't the case, but it is what it is (but really though, if you're already feeling this way did they really care about you in the first place? Let's be real here for a second. No one really gives a shit about any of us). Anyways, seriously, I think about this all the time. Not just me wanting to die, but that I can continue to try and stay alive and do the best I can and all that good stuff, but also have an exit strategy. Personally, I have a reliable means and a plan already written out so if I choose to die I can just go ahead. I'm allowed to leave when I say so. Nobody can stop me if I keep this a secret.#Suicidal_intention
i’m too scared to do it. idk what i’m meant to do but all i think about is death 24/7 and i’m so tired of living but i’m too fucking scared to do anything. what am i meant to do?  it’s eating me up and i don’t know how to deal with it#Suicidal_intention
I lost my job, potential career path, my best friend and my girlfriend in the past month. I’m in constant pain due to a rotting tooth that I can’t afford to fix. I have no money and no car and next to no motivation because all of the people I was working for are gone now. I came back home to try to find peace amongst family members but my uncle isn’t the same person. He’s angry, bitter, abusive and cruel toward everyone around him, but his pain makes him hold onto arrogance to the point that he thinks he can do no wrong. Not to mention he has been trying to convince all of my family members here that I’m addicted to weed, because 1) I didn’t eat much when we went to lunch (maybe because I’m more depressed than I’ve ever been?), 2) I’ve smoked VERY occasionally for a few years, and 3) I’m skinny (have fluctuated maybe 5 pounds in about 6 years). This would be bad enough but he uses it as fuel to attack my incredible mother, her parenting skills and lifestyle, because his own kids hate him because he physically abused them. I just want to lean back and disappear from this world. For a while things felt like a dream and I hit myself to wake up. But I’m past that phase now and overwhelmed with despair. I’m completely devoid of any positivity. I’m just walking around until something changes. Here’s hoping I drop dead.#Suicidal_intention
i feel so trapped in this life i don't want to do this anymore and wake up and have to continue to live, but at the same time i feel like i should be grateful for things that i have. but then i continue to tell myself that i didn't ask to be born. and these thoughts go back and forth and it's driving me insane and idk what to do#Suicidal_intention
I will tape a plastic bag over my head. It will take me about 10 minutes to pass out, and another 10 to die. I feel oddly calm right now. My heart is beating out of my chest with excitement though. Wish me luck.#Suicidal_intention
Actually, my mom caught me, and everything is in chaos. My rope broke but I was already unconscious when it happened and when I woke up, it was at the time my mom saw me and I was bleeding and very purple and everything is swollen, even up until now. No one really understands how frustrating it is how I can't ever express the pain I'm feeling, so I always took it out on myself. It would've been nice if my attempt was successful so I don't have to deal with myself anymore. My schoolwork is piling up, and so does my suicidal tendencies.#Suicidal_intention
I just finished my suicide note, it was hard at the end when naming my parents and sibling but it gave me relief. Just knowing I have a note and a way out is reassuring to me.#Suicidal_intention
It will never be better for me, and I know it. I know that suicide will be the best thing for me#Suicidal_intention
I've been thinking quite a lot about it lately. I'm on a huge debt, and kept thinking about ending my life because I've become a huge failure myself. I still have passion in music, and yet still struggling to make a living, and constantly wanted to remove myself. A lot of people said that I'm exaggerating it, and I don't know if my thoughts need help or not.#Suicidal_intention
I need to kill myself. This summer, June 29. I have my method planned out and I’m about to write my note. When you think about it, I’m not really killing myself. We all die at some point, it’s inevitable. It’s certain. So, who are to say when we can die “naturally”? If you know what I mean? All I would actually be doing is speeding up a process that will happen either way. I’ll just get it over with. Death is always at the finish line, we will all die no matter what we do. So why not die just a couple of years earlier than “planned”? Death is death no matter how it happens, “suicide” and “natural death” is literally the same thing executed in different ways.#Suicidal_intention
heck my pain will all be gone no more suffering why the fuck is there a stigma against it whats the point in carrying on living if u just hate yur life#Suicidal_intention
knowing i'll die someday, by suicide or by something else, makes me feel better and calmer#Suicidal_intention
I need help with my mental health but I can't see myself actively seeking support without doing something drastic and I feel close to committing suicide#Suicidal_intention
Hello Reddit I am 21 and In college, about a year ago I got a DUI and haven't really been the same since. For the past nine months I have had many suicidal thoughts and ideations. I have a loving family and amazing girlfriend but somehow it does not seem like enough. I feel really hopeless all the time and some days have a ton of motivation to work hard and I enjoy my day. Other days, I get triggered so easily and go back into a depressed hopeless state. I have come close to ending my life a couple times but have not gotten the courage to do so which I am glad. I feel like I am just on autopilot in my life, I show little to no emotions with anyone but myself. Even my girlfriend who I want to tell everything I don't because It will just scare her and no one knows how to handle someone who wants to kill themselves. I keep all my emotions inside and when I am alone is the only time I let them out. I exercise everyday, get a good GPA and have a job with a great family and people around me but none of them know what is really going on in my head. I don't know if its all from my DUI or if the repercussions of the DUI are what made me realize how sad I really am. I saw a therapist for a couple months but it did not help at all. I do not want to go on medication I don't know what mental health issues I have besides maybe depression but feel like pills will not help me. A few months ago I wrote a suicide note and look at it every time I think about finally doing it and seeing the words I wrote back then make me not want to do it. The main reason I don't want to is how my family friends and girlfriend will be affected, it would destroy them and seem so out of the blue to them. On the surface I am an extremely social happy guy and never show whats really underneath. The only thing that has stopped me from killing myself so far is how it would alter the lives of those around me. The past few days I have thought about breaking up with my girlfriend before committing suicide I know it wouldn't do much but might make it a little easier on her. I have been more distant than I ever have been with the rest of my friends and family. I have eight roommates who i am good friends with but lately shut myself off in my room watching movies all day and researching ways of suicide.#Suicidal_intention
I’ve been in a relationship for the past 2 and a half years. Before I found her I was really suicidal, the thought of suicide came to me every second of everyday. However, the relationship has now ended and the suicidal thoughts have came back and are worse than before. I’m hanging on by a thread. The only thing that’s stopping me is my single mother and my 5 year old brother and the pain they’d have to deal with if I actually kill myself. I’ve thought about several methods I could do it but they are the only ones holding me back.#Suicidal_intention
I’ve come to a point in my life that I have to recognize that, eventually, I will kill myself. I’m only in the beginning stages of planning, and it might be some time before I can have everything arranged. I’m just looking for other people who I can talk to without them trying to convince me not to. #Suicidal_intention
I just want to die#Suicidal_intention
In the last 3-4 years, I started to have suicidal ideations. I am an alcoholic, have ADHD, and have pretty much ruined my life in every aspect. The alcohol is the only thing I truly enjoy. I'm 44 now and have accepted that I will not be able to get married and raise a family. I can't keep a job or a relationship long enough. I am bankrupt. I can only get low-paying menial jobs that I get sick of very quick. I will either drink myself to death or jump off a bridge before my 50th birthday. When I think about my fate, I am comforted. I don't have to live in my personal hell if I don't want to. Knowing I can end things on my terms whenever I decide brings relief. Anyone else feel better when they think about suicide?#Suicidal_intention
she’s just been sleeping for about two days now, waking up now and then and taking a few pills to fall back asleep. If she continuously does this and forces her body to sleep for a few more days, could she die? She’s not eating or anything, only sleeping.#Suicidal_intention
It wasn't my first time, and it certainly won't be the last, but I attempted suicide twice, technically in one day, this week. I tried drinking rubbing alcohol after some shit happened with my partner (please don't try this, it burns like hell and then the pain fades.) and then, about twenty-one hours laters, I tried to slit my jugular open (you'd think trying with three different knives would yield some results, but nope.) Trying to sleep it off and then waking up the next morning has always been odd. Opening your eyes and looking about is like looking through a warped glass window, or a faulty camera lens. Those are eyes that should have been shut, gone dark, permanently, just a few hours ago. Getting out of bed, or hauling yourself off the floor, feels so stiff and unnatural. These limbs should have stilled, these feet should no longer be able to walk. You never planned to wake up this morning. But now you're here. Carrying on like nothing happened creates a disjointed sense of reality, like everything is far away and unreachable. People laugh, and slap you on the back, and say hello, without the faintest idea what you tried to do. What you almost achieved. I could have been at peace by now. Instead, it's just another day. You'd think I'd be used to it by now. But the uncanny feeling doesn't ever change.#Suicidal_intention
"I go through the same suicidal feeling almost every day. I don’t want to live. Still i drift along with the flow mostly because I don't have the will to end it all. Have thought of every possible way to kill myself and nothing makes me go ""hmm that seems like something i can do"" but rather i get very scared. I don't understand the reasoning of people who say that suicide is for cowards when in reality it takes a lot of courage to finally end your life. I wish I had that kind of courage, Atleast that way i wouldn't be suffering this much."#Suicidal_intention
"I have been dealing with anxiety due to my narcissistic fathers' alcohol abuse. I have been an academically bright student and the so called ""good son"" as per societal norms, even though I hate it now. (I am basically Manny from Modern Family). But not feeling loved despite being a ""good"" child is just killing me. I have posted to reddit about this in other subs but today it was an extreme. My father lashed out on me yesterday and I stored it in me. Today morning I got an anxiety/panic attack - first one after 4 weeks of therapy and it was so bad I wanted to just jump off a cliff. I wrote all the things that bothered me on a piece of paper."#Suicidal_intention
After a rough breakup with my girlfriend after a really bad mistake I don’t know what to do anymore and I only see suicide as a way out. I’m sorry and goodbye. Have a nice day.#Suicidal_intention
No, really, 30 - I've kept count. I've had precisely 30 attempts, none of them have worked. I've been close enough to see my life flashing by, yet suffered so few lasting effects I've never even went to the hospital. I honestly feel like a freak, or an anomaly. I'm the one person that genuinely wants off this planet, yet I seem to be the one that can't die. I've tried so many times that I'm numb to the concept of suicide most of the time - sometimes I realize the gravity of what I've done and just fall apart. I've done hours of research into every method, still nothing. I've used my belt more when trying to hang myself than I have actually wearing it. It's a crushing feeling. All the feelings of being trapped, of there being no escape - are even worse when you can't even take the easy way out. All I do is sit with a guitar in my hand to distract me, if I even look at my belt, I know I'll probably try it again, survive, and have yet another horrific memory. Treatment is going slow, I can't do anything about my situation, the walls are closing in, and I can't even take my own life after trying more than most people do in their lifetimes.#Suicidal_intention
I’ve been suicidal for years and it keeps getting worse.it’s at the point where suicide is the only thing I think about. I cannot get any help since I’m still 17 and my parents refuse to get me help. I had a psychologist for a while but it didn’t help at all. I’m in so much pain and I can’t do this anymore.#Suicidal_intention
i'm not going to go into too much detail unless it's needed (just ask) but i've planned to kill myself tomorrow. i've been suicidal for quite a while, never gone through with anything but everything has gotten a lot worse recently so here i am. anyway, there is still that one last rational thought left working in my brain telling me to go seek help but i've never gone to the er for anything other than physical injuries before. #Suicidal_intention
I’m having this on going debate with myself with rather I should end my life this summer or wait and try to accomplish at least one thing before I die and don’t try to talk me outta it because my future is bleak if I wait until I accomplish my goal I would die having achieved something is it really worth it though if I’m gonna die right after and be forgotten about#Suicidal_intention
nothing much, just wondering if it's even possible to not have suicidal thoughts at all. maybe i once had that, as a kid, a young child. but for as long as i can remember now, there's not a day where i close my eyes and i dont see myself trying to take my own life over and over again. i just wonder how it is like for them, what are their brains filled with, because mine is mainly made up of different methods that i can kill myself with.#Suicidal_intention
I remember wishing I was dead as early as kindergarten. As I got older that turned into more specific suicidal ideation. Last year I made a suicide attempt, but called 911 at the last minute. I was in the hospital for a week and then a few days in inpatient psych. I in therapy now, 4.5 hours a week. I’m learning how to manage the distress and emotions.#Suicidal_intention
Everyday since then has been hell. I am in so much of pain and agony. All I think about is living till the weekend for some respite. I’m so lonely and unhappy. I live in a country where it’s legal to kill gay people and all I do is hide and erase anything that may tell people who I am. I feel like a corpse, I can only feel flashes of happiness. I don’t even know I love or like anything. I just feel empty on the inside. My family doesn’t understand me and they keep accusing me of being arrogant and indifferent. I go to work because no one else in my family has a job and they are so thankless. They make me feel so guilty of not doing enough. We have so much of financial issues. I wish I was dead. Everyday I wake up, I always feel so sad that I never died in my sleep. I want to make it end. I want to put an end to everything. I’m so tired of being scared, I’m so tired of not feeling God when I pray. I’m so tired of existing in a world where more than half the world can and will kill me for existing. I feel so lonely and I don’t know if there is a point. I have never been loved and I don’t think anyone will miss me if I drop dead. I wish I didn’t exist. I wish I didn’t have to keep living to put food or a roof over my family’s heads. I wish I had died when I swallowed half a bottle of painkillers.#Suicidal_intention
I was doing fine I had a normal day it wasn’t even bad. I was just sitting on my couch and started crying and it was like I couldn’t breathe and there was so much pain. And I went to my bed to lay down and it was like waves of sadness and my body felt so heavy like I couldn’t move. I don’t understand how people say it isn’t physical. I feel like I took an anesthetic or something. My body is heavy and it’s hard to even type this. I think I would try to kill myself if I wasn’t so drained. I am miserable. I don’t feel anything and I feel everything at once. It really hurts and I don’t know how to handle this. I don’t even know what happened. I was okay and out of nowhere These thoughts of suicide came and I wstarted sobbing. My medicine isn’t working. I’m on lamictal and it’s not helping. I feel like hurting myself and I’m really trying not to.#Suicidal_intention
I've been looking to motivate at some point, everyone would just tell you that you have many things to live for. The most important thing you ever have is your own, are all the time I've been alive is just pain, no matter where, how... since I have memory I have always felt like shit. I don't have friends, my family don't care about me, my grandma passed away recently, she has always made me feel better, she was the reason why I'm still here. There's ain't no reason to live anymore. I couldn't be more isolated from others, I'm just feeling how time just hurts. I live in latin america, and all live live here is deplorable, I think I'm just making me a favor, I don't have any money to get some pills and alcohol or even a car to crash my self, don't even have where to lay once I'm gone.#Suicidal_intention
I suffer from severe hyperacusis and Tinnitus. I want to commit suicide. I tried twice but whit benzos and did not kill you. Please give me forces to make this final decition#Suicidal_intention
About 3 weeks ago I took around 90 Zyprexa pills with the hopes it would be fatal, unfortunately it wasn't, and instead, I suffered a blackout with seizure like effects, followed by a trip to the emergency room where I laid out a two day coma. How do I feel about this now? Well I'm still disappointed that it didn't work. I still wish to be dead. If anyone knows of any easy oral suicide methods that work please let me know. Thanks.#Suicidal_intention
I just want to sleep forever my life sucks! I have social anxiety and depression my life has been crap for YEARS. I feel like a total failure, no good job, I have a car and I graduated however my life still sucks! I hate all these memories from since I developed my skin condition that caused me to be tortured and bullied it went with me for my entire life. I made 3 mistakes with guys and just wish none of it ever happened. I don’t want to feel think and remember anymore I’m so tired.#Suicidal_intention
Its hard for even me to believe that i am writing in a reddit suicide watch today because i used to be that guy who told other people that people who commit suicide are cowards & i used to help others overcome their suicidal thoughts by telling them life is precious & you cant undo a mistake like suicide because once life is gone its gone forever, money love come & go but life once gone is gone forever. I used to think only weak minded people think about suicide. But i was wrong. Right now what im experiencing is beyond words can describe. Even though I've had a pretty decent & good life with the most loving parents in the world who sacrificed everything they could so that their son gets to live a better life than they got. Being an only child i have got the love more than i deserve. The only problem is that i didn't wanted to live an mediocre life of 9-5 like them. So after my engineering, i took risk of investing alot of my parents money ( half of total net worth of our family ), few years passed & i made huge profits like 10x on our total investment. It was going on pretty good, was feeling like a genius for making an risky choice of not doing job & doing something on my own instead like business & trading. I had earned more than 10x on our total investment. It was equivalent to me doing an Software engineer job for 30 years. ( My age is not even 30 yet ) . But worst thing happened. I got liquidated one day & lost it all. Even though i used to tell people that money come & go but life doesn't come back once gone. I cant take this loss anymore, imagine losing 30 years of work money in 1 day. I had achieved the life i wanted to, i had almost escaped the mediocre life by earning what I could've earned by working for 30 years, i achieved that before even turning 30. But now its all gone. Now if i do job then it will take 30 years to breakeven where i was in 2021 beginning. By 2051 i will have the same amount i had in 2021 beginning, which is fucking depressing. I cant do this. If i wanted to do a job, I would've been doing it without risking my parents money. I just cant live an mediocre shitty life. My parents & relatives think that i am an intelligent guy who will go through life easily. I didnt tell them about the profits either. And I haven't told anyone else about the losses either. Now the reality has hit hard to me, that i am just an useless guy who got lucky in those intital profits & the final return i got is what defines me. I lost what my parents earned in their life through sacrificing their wishes. I feel guilty of ruining my entire life & the life of my parents. Even though they never give importance to money over health / life. Even though i know if i tell them about the losses they will just be like its okay son, atleast everyone in our family is happy & healthy thats the only thing matters. But i just cant take the losses knowing that i cannot ever recover in my lifetime & i will have to live a shitty mediocre 9-5 life. I have been thinking about suicide alot & the only thing thats stopping from doing it is the thought of my parents dealing with life after i am gone. Because they sacrificed their wishes / choices / comfort / luxury so that i could live a better life as they put their hopes on me only. And if i commit suicide then it will be like a betrayal from the one & only on whom they had put all their hopes on & did sacrifices for. Also i brought a loving dog (puppy) into our family few years ago & i cant imagine what my pet dog will go through once i am gone because whenever i have been away for even a week, my parents used to call me & tell how the pet dog good boy whines waiting for me at the usual spot he watches people coming to the house. I cant do this to my family, if i do suicide it will be a selfish decision. Because i know by my suicide i will be taking away the life of my parents & my pet good boy. I cant do that to them. All their lives they have given me love & in return how can i give them so much pain that too permanent pain for the rest of their lives. This is pretty much my situation being stuck in between the choice of SUICIDE due to losses & nothing else to live for, & the choice to survive for the sake of my parents, my pet dog good boy, my family just like they sacrificed their wishes of luxury for me, i might have to sacrifice the wish to suicide due to losses to keep them away from the pain of my suicide. Also i cant imagine the pain of my parents if i commit suicide, & who will take care of them in their old age? If i do this, then its exactly like parents abandoning their kid when they're born. If my parents didnt abandon me when i was born, then how can i abandon them in their old age by selfish decision like my suicide.#Suicidal_intention
I just want to die all the time. Only time I don't is when someone is holding me. But I hate existing on this earth. All. The. Time. I just want to walk into a field until I reach a cliff. I live in a mountainous area, I could find one easily. I just have to write a note. Don't care who gets my shit, it's not mine anyways. Just put on a nice dress and fall to my death Except I don't have the balls. Literally and figuratively. I could bear the thought of being caught. I could bear the thought of surviving. The medical bills. The concerned yelling from my parents. The lying kids who act like they care. They don't. They'll be all pity. Oh how they would run to me. Or not. They don't care about me or my mental stability, it's all about them. They're not my friends at all. I hate every one of those lying bastards. My parents call me selfish for thinking like that, oh how someone has to find my body. How detrimental that'll be. I don't care I don't want to hear it. I can't commit suicide because if I survive my life will become mental hell of yelling and lairs, more than it already is.#Suicidal_intention
This is the best scenario and I fantasize about it everyday.#Suicidal_intention
My 5 year partner passed away due to covid. We were planning to get married after the pandemic started to calm down but we had been living together for the 5 years. We were on a really happy relationship and prior to get sick we completed the process to buy a house together. We followed all the safety guidelines, we were working from home, we did not attend parties or reunions, we saw our parents every other week or month and the weeks prior getting sick we did not attend a single place where us or other people were not using mask or respecting the social distance, just got out to get groceries or to complete the paperwork of the house. I did have mild symptoms, i am 24 year old but he (32 years) was sick for a couple of weeks and we decided that the best was for him to get hospitalized after his oxygen levels started dropping. I was not able to see him during the two weeks he was on the hospital prior to dying. The year we spend together on our apartment was one of the happiest of my life, to be honest if i had to spent the rest of my life on lockdown with him i would have been happy. We were so open and honest with each other, we had a lot of fun, we were both huge introverts who found their place. I had everything i wanted. I want to be mad or say that life is unfair but i do not believe in anything, so i think this is just the way the things happened. My family and friends have been supporting me and I’m taking therapy as well. But I am on a place where I just don’t wanna be here anymore, it just doesn’t make sense. I truly believe that life is worthy but I don’t want it anymore, he and i had a lot of plans together and now that he’s gone, am i just supposed to continue without him? If I’m gone everyone will just continue with their lives and that’s ok. I want to save some money so I can pay for my funeral and correct the bank accounts beneficiaries ready, so at least my parents do not have to worry about that in case I’m gone. I have been searching on ways to kill myself on a painless way. I know that everyone says suicide it’s not an option but it seems unfair that I have to be alive when I don’t want it.#Suicidal_intention
"I can't hold it anymore, the more I wake up and think about things like how people around me are cool/happy/more successfull/handome/beautiful and how you have so many problems, living with stereotypes following you from like your childhood but you are 26, and you have inferiority complex around so many things. The thing is that even parents with there ""everything is gonna be fine one day"" isn't helping no matter how you think about it. And they aren't that much supportive: so many problems, so many different points of views over normal things, so many quarrels. Wasting so much time and resources into trying to live, trying to achieve things in personal life, at work or somewhere else but everything you get is a ""you'd better dissapear"" type of replies. I don't even have real-life friends. Most of them are my ex-colleagues but they aren't interested in talking with me and when you call them to have a walk, they find so many excuses. I am soon to become 27 years old but I just want to die before this 27 years old mess appears and seeing how much health problems I have these days I don't think it will last that long. I am not even fixing my health problems, funny. The people around can say like ""have some kind of motivation"" but what kind of motivation can you get if you are being tagged at like ""you are an ugly man, f_ck off and better k_s"" or things like ""live for yourself"". I am sorry but no matter how you are calling yourself anti-social, human is a social ""animal"" and every human wants to get noticed, to love and be loved, to So many ""to"" to say. I apologize in advance if this type of thoughts isn't welcomed but I basically have nowhere to share with all this and an everyday increase in ""I don't even wanna wake up or live longer"" just makes it even worse. Even if I am found dieing I don't want to get rescued, I will peacefully accept it at young age because there is no other way for me to live any longer."#Suicidal_intention
i dont have a plan i dont know what im going to do im writing this at midnight i know tomorrow i'll probably be gone im not gonna go to school. as a a good-bye, here's what i wrote earlier, turning my feelings into words: one day i'll die, but today i'll live i can't say the same about tomorrow and tomorrow is approaching fast each tick of the clock each change of numbers they scare me as death grows near awakening from its slumber i'm tired of being strong i'm done with being brave i want to go on onto a new day , i want everything to be sunshine and rainbows but thats not how life goes while my sadness grows i lie down awake crying, slowly, dying, slowly#Suicidal_intention
I don't want anyone saying not to do it. I know I need to stop existing. I just don't know how to do it. In the past, overdosing + cutting didn't work and also these left me very ill and in pain for a long time which I don't want to go through again. I just want the easiest way out which will definitely kill me and not leave me just messed up. please someone help me it's too much.#Suicidal_intention
thats it, thats the post. i honestly cant wait to kill myself, this shit aint fun at all#Suicidal_intention
Over suffering in silence constantly just wish people knew how close I really am to just walking off this planet or understood how I am feeling. Will be dead soon enough if I can't fix this fucked up head of mine and all the thoughts that plague my mind.#Suicidal_intention
i just want to be dead for god’s sake.#Suicidal_intention
"I'll be graduating in a few days from some fancy-ass high school (equivalent) and I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for the whole duration, and I don't even have a reason for my sorry ass behaviour. I have every opportunity to achieve high grades - No other work or home duties. This last year my attendance has dropped largely due to me turning 18 and my parents not being notified of my absence. I feel like shit for doing it. I know I'll get an F in the last math course but I can still graduate. Today my Biology teacher said that I have a few hours to hand in an essay that I have not done and instead of doing the fucking thing I instead spent the time in some stress bubble wishing to die. I often end up in that place of stress where I can't do anything except feel like shit - especially close to a deadline. Usually, I've felt more inclined to start working once the panic hits but now I just sort of freeze. The only way out of that zone is twofold: Eat and think of ways to kill myself. I've settled on slitting my throat with a sharp knife for long as it ties in with my interest in knives and I convinced myself to do so during one of my ""stress bubbles"". It went in maybe one or two millimetres before I came to my senses and put some pressure so my shirt wouldn't be covered in blood. I've cleaned the cut and put on some duck tape. I clearly need help because I'm not sure that I'll stop the next time. Even if I graduate my issues won't go away overnight and I will likely be put in similarly stressful situations."#Suicidal_intention
I’ve tried so many things. Statistically I have like almost zero chance of responding to an antidepressant at this point. I just can’t keep doing this. Killing myself is inevitable. Why put it off?#Suicidal_intention
I did it I drank bleach now I'm just waiting for it to kill me. IDK if I drank enough but hopefully by this time tomorrow I won't have to think about anything or anyone#Suicidal_intention
There was a time, honestly not too long ago, where I could say I was interesting and full of life. I have a bachelor's degree in Neuroscience, no student loans despite coming from a household of the lowest income one could be. I worked in a behavioral research lab testing the mediating effects of prenatal choline supplementation on amnesia caused by traumatic brain injury. I trained in violin and I had a varied, expansive music taste. I'm well traveled with 9 countries under my belt. I was into pro level multicultural cooking. I loved to read, write, play games, watch documentaries, workout, play tennis, and spend time with my friends and family. I wanted to be a lawyer. Now I'm nothing. I have nothing to show for any of that. My depression has reached a point where I struggle to form sentences. I struggle to remember news I read 20 minutes ago. I don't even care about my body and hygiene anymore. I'm the worst big sister, always dumping how I feel on my sister who looked up to me. I can't help my family with anything. I avoid my friends and let them down constantly. I've been unemployed for a year post-grad. I thought my intelligence would always be there for me. My social skills too even when I didn't have the energy. Now, all I can do is sit silently or compliment things or comment on the sorroundings when I'm around people. My head is so empty and worthless. I'm a waste of everything I've been given. I can say I was blessed but was I really for everything to turn to sand in my hands. Even as I displayed all the initial traits, I never had romantic love. Not even a prospect to make it seem like I could have a chance of love, a relationship, marriage, or kids. I think people could sense I was meant to be nothing. I'm just sorry for my friends and family who were dragged into my trap of a life. I'm so disgusted with myself and confused how it turned out like this. I used to have high functioning depression. It completely took me out now. I just need and want to end it, I don't think I'm coming back. No matter how hard I try, if my intelligence isn't there and I have no energy or motivation, I'm living to die and dragging everyone down with me. I just need to die and stop wasting more time on this earth.#Suicidal_intention
"Went to a bridge yesterday. I just stood there for a while. Thinking of the past years. I have been thinking about this for so long. About 15 years now and I'm only 24. Whilst looking down I realized it was way to low. Sure, the fall could kill me, but the risk of becomming a potato was to high. What scared me the most was the pain. I grasped the railing tightly and shifted forward a bit so I could get a good look on the road below. As with all my ""attempts"" I didn't have the balls to actually do it. It was the same at the train station, with the belt, with the car and in the river. Throughout all the years I have never actually tried. Which is so fucking depressing - I can't even be suicidal right.I don't want to wake up tomorrow, I don't want to keep working at a job I can't handle, I don't want to wait the years I have left in queue for therapy. I wish I could press pause, and just never unpause"#Suicidal_intention
Every little thing that unhinges me gets me to grab a sharp object, close my eyes and cut as fast as I can. I’m sick of doing that and then feeling like shit while I clean my blood or worse, when I wake up with dry blood on my arms. I feel stupid and I promise myself I won’t do it again, but I do. I’m sick of dealing with this alone #Suicidal_intention
I've spent the last two months pretending to take my meds only to collect them and I have successfully collected 39 tablets of sertaline ( 100 mg) and 39 tablets of etilaam. I also have a bottle of wine ready. i planned on waiting till I have 50 pills of each but even 40 seems like enough I guess. I've also created a fake Instagram account that I've used as my own version of a suicide letter. I still have a lot to do to complete that. but once I'm done, im planning on leaving as soon as possible. I also have to clear things up with my boyfriend we're not on the best terms right now. I don't think I'll be able to wait till I can meet him one last time because of the lockdown here. I've also started clearing up things I've written in the past that I don't want people to find. I don't know if I can stay long enough to complete the suicide note. Im on the edge and im so tired of being this way. I hate myself and I hate my life. and I know that sooner or later I'm gonna do it.#Suicidal_intention
Nothing in particular happened. I'm just feeling very low today. I want to die so badly. I'm just tired of all the pain and sadness. I think I could pull it off, but I could never hurt my husband like that. It just makes me feel worse, I feel trapped. I just want to not want to die.#Suicidal_intention
If I can barely handle the regret of missing out most of my life at 26, I can't even imagine the pain 10 years from now. I simply wish I could end it right now. It's going to save me so much unnecessary pain down the line... just a little more courage.#Suicidal_intention
If I take a whole bottle of opioids would I die because that’s what I want to do, I want to die !!#Suicidal_intention
my depression, my anxiety, my ocd & intrusive thoughts all of it. last night i got into a fight with my dad again over literally nothing and he pushed me and hit me and touched me in ways i wasn’t at all comfortable with. he told me to kill myself and threatened to kill me himself. he called me lazy and stupid and “dumb bitch” and a “stupid whore”. he’s been increasingly more of a dick in general lately and i feel trapped because i’m stuck living here until i’m financially stable which doesn’t seem like something that’s gonna happen soon considering i’m a high school dropout with no job lmao. my bf who i was highly considering breaking up with also told me he loved me yesterday which just adds a whole other layer to the shit storm that is my life. i really don’t know how much longer i can live like this.#Suicidal_intention
As always even stronger, than before. My last attempt was unsuccessful, but here we go again after taking a short break from trying to die.#Suicidal_intention
I'm not sure how to preface this, but I guess I just need an outlet at this point. I'm a 23M and for the last week I've been strongly contemplating suicide. Most of my life I've been depressed, but I've also had periods of happiness as well. I'm an overachiever and in all reality my life is golden. I'm not rich, but I grew up spoiled and was raised in a stable household. My biggest struggle in this life has always been my self esteem and confidence. I'm very lonely and have few friends. I've never been intimate with a women or even been on a date. I hate myself for many reasons, and this weighs on me every day I'm alive. I have a good future and a stable job but ultimately this means nothing to me anymore. I'm tired of being alone and just going through the motions. I see no point in continuing to fight. I'm very aware that my suicide will likely destroy my parents and siblings, but I'm sure they will move on eventually. I've considered the method many times and I decided that I want to go out doing what I love. I'm a huge automotive enthusiast and I own a relatively quick car. I figure if I can hit 130mph and find something solid enough to run into that should certainly be fatal. My family also won't have to find me dead. If anyone reads this I appreciate your time and I hope you don't share the same fate as me.#Suicidal_intention
I’m probably gonna kill myself tonight and I’m kinda scared. I know things aren’t gonna get better things can only get worse here on out.#Suicidal_intention
I’ve already taken a few pills, I think I might take a few more and end it all. I’ve been let down once again by someone. I let them back into my life and I’ve quickly seen their true colours. They’ve hurt me so much in a short space of time. I’m fed up with all the drama. No one will care if I go. I’m done with all this pain and suffering#Suicidal_intention
Im thinking of breaking up with my boyfriend due to political differences and I'd honestly rather kill myself than break up with him. My mum also hit me and yelled at me for crying. I feel like I dont have anyone. I have no friends I dont have anyone. I talked to someone and they said we should break up I really dont want to I dont have anyone. I live with my mum who constantly yells at me for crying. I feel like it'd be better if I was dead I can tell that the world hates me. My boyfriend doesn't care about me. I'm tired of everything I just want to die#Suicidal_intention
I almost killed my self by overdosing a few weeks ago, the recovery was fine but i was ashamed with myself that i couldnt do it propely and knew i will have to go through other things now. Im being forced to go to therapy but my parents answer all my questions for me like they know what i feel, i have to take medicine for my depression. I know its expected but i hate being treated like a crazy person, im barely allowed anything in my room because they think im going to try kill myself with anything i can find. None of this helps me, if anything it makes it worse i hate my parents and now they are forcing themselves on me trying to tell me how stupid i was and i couldve died like i already didnt know and i cant even self harm to get through the day anymore.#Suicidal_intention
Hi, I am in my last year of high-school and am about to fail it. For reference, my dad and my mom are divorced and he only contacts my sister and I through the phone. Because of him, I get anxiety when I hear arguments, am around drunk people, and more. I have anxiety attacks whenever I talk to him through the phone, even if he isn’t attacking me. He usually yells at my sister and mom because he knows I’m suicidal. Can’t yell at the fragile one, right? This makes me feel worse like a burden because my sister has to endure his heat when it’s not even her fault. I have been suicidal since 7th grade. It’s gotten worse and worse through the years, and I really might do it. I told my parents I wanted to die in 11th grade. They were worried at first, but eventually they told me to book my own appointment. I didn’t. Because of covid-19, my school moved us into distanced learning. This only made school worse for me. I can’t even get out of bed some days to do school. I can’t get myself to do homework or anything. I tried contacting my counselor and my teachers, but nothing helped. I’ve been slowly working on my missing assignments, but it’s overwhelming. My last day of school is this Wednesday. I probably have over 100 missing assignments. It’s important that I graduate for many reasons. My mom is also urging me that I do. I don’t want her to hate me. It’s just so much. I just want to die. There’s too much work to try to make up, and I’m far too broken to want to try to fix. I don’t have anything going for me. I’m not smart, or attractive, or talented. I’m just here wasting everyone’s time and money. I have tried OD’ing before. It didn’t work and I woke up with a bad stomachache. Sometimes, I get a knife and hold it against my wrist to see if it’ll draw blood. It doesn’t. Before I sleep, I cry to myself and beg anyone or anything to give me a terminal illness or anything. I feel like when I don’t graduate, I’ll snap. I’ll book an Uber to the closest bridge and jump. I’ve already written my suicide note. When I’m gone, my dad will finally stop bothering my mom and sister too. Everything will be better. I’ll be happier. No one seems to care about me. And I don’t want them to. Everyone has their own problems. I’ve heard the words, “If you want to die, then just die”, from my sister before. My friends say “you’re still young!” and don’t understand. I don’t care anymore. Sorry if it seems like just another teenager complaining. I know a lot of people have it a lot worse. Sorry.#Suicidal_intention
I have had negative thoughts before but never like today. About 3 years ago my bestfriend’s boyfriend raped me while I slept and I woke up towards the end of it. I’ve been with my boyfriend for 9 months and I’ve always felt like he was the one. He knows be best and knows and loves me even with the baggage I carry from my past... but on Saturday he raped me the exact same way. I am so hurt that I’m not seeing anything worth living for. All dreams I had for the future are gone and all I feel is pain. I’m not here asking for attention. I just don’t know how to get out of this pit. I’ve never felt like this before#Suicidal_intention
I've been trying to get rid of myself for the past few years. But every time someone has stopped me. I live in a country where you can't just get guns. So it's either jump or hang. And people have stopped me every time. So now I'm doing almost everything I can to get cancer. Then nobody (accept) hospitals will be able to help me#Suicidal_intention
I hate my life bc I get bullied for being overweight and I try so much to lose weight,also my parents don't believe in me my grandma was the only one there now that she's gone I just can't deal with life anymore cyberbullied,beaten up bc my weight being called a freak it all hurts so much honestly but I got no one here for me anymore. I just think that if I were dead my parents would still be together and if I go like a couple days without food ill lose weight and not be an ugly piece of shit no one cou,d stand being g around me so if I die it'll be better than living this right am I right?#Suicidal_intention
Today she'll get what this worthless girl deserves. I have done nothing good ever to anyone. I'm a burden. I ruin everything for everyone. I ruin everything I touch. Maybe it'll be better off without me. I wanted to be a lawyer and I was goddamn studying hard for it. I'm literally the most pathetic person to ever exist. I blame people for the things I do I guess. I can't deal with this feeling anymore. I don't to live anymore. I don't want to be a liability. I hope something good comes out of this.#Suicidal_intention
I want it to end so badly. It's all I can think about. There's nothing I can do to fix anything now since it's too late. I hope I get killed in some accident or something everyday. Of course it will never happen because I'm not that lucky. I have such horrible luck it's not even funny and I'm just tired of it. It'd be so much easier to finally just kill myself if everyone hated me.#Suicidal_intention
I've grown more and more dissociated with this world, I identify with nothing and no one. I believe that I don't belong here and like my mind actually belongs to some kind of otherworldly thing. I'm therefore gonna try to reach that world, and the only way I see a way out of this world is death as we know it. And I going for it.#Suicidal_intention
I wake up everyday wanting to die, I can't handle it. I need help but my mom refuses to get me the help I need. I've been looking for ways to die. im seriously considering it. and if whatever I do doesn't kill me at least I'll be getting help. idk anymore. I don't want to live much longer. im a mistake. a joke. an outcast to everyone I've ever known and each day it kills me inside knowing that I'm not good for anything and my whole life is a joke. I just want a quick and painless way out. anyone know where I can get cyanide?#Suicidal_intention
"while there are people who are suffering from poverty, wars, illnesses; animals are being treated bad; nature is being slowly destroyed; I, who live in comfort, want to die everyday and am unhappy. I can't even write it because of strong emotions right now, I am an overreacting fucker with first-world-problems. I want to die, dissappear, be in a fucking void"#Suicidal_intention
I’m a 14 year old boy and I’ve been struggling lately with school and I’m certain I will fail I just feel like I will be able to live through that. I have a good life, good family. But I’m just tired of this world I fear death but it seems like the only option. I feel trapped because if I do this my parents and family would be devastated and I’m my dads only boy. I just wish I was not born. All I do is sit in my room and when I come out I put on a smile and pretend nothing is going on but in my head its a whole different story. Sometimes I think what would life be like if I was not born. What would my parents be doing my older brother. I’m lost and I fear I will have no other choice soon.#Suicidal_intention
I can’t stop crying. It hurts so bad. I’m so miserable and I can’t handle the pain anymore, I want to die so bad. I want to hurt myself so bad. I’m hyperventilating and having a severe mental breakdown and anxiety attack. I want help but I think I’m beyond it. I just wish I was dead. I wish I could stop breathing.#Suicidal_intention
I was about to jump off a bridge right now. I dont know why i couldn't do it. I have done it in my thoughts countless times.#Suicidal_intention
I have no one in my life anymore My gf cheated, my family hates me, my dogs died,my brother is a manipulating whore Finally my parents gave up on me too cause of my brother's lies I used to rely on a good friend of mine, they went by the name VJ and I haven't been able to talk to them at all,really cause they won't reply The only person I relied on to get me through was vj I don't wanna trouble anyone with me,vj will prolly think I'm bluffing or smthn cause I have felt suicidal 3x before All i am, is a coward dont even have strength to pull the trigger Can't even tell my friends about it no family for sure All I have is a cat, I'll probably leave my dor open tonight so she can go survive I am sorry,everyone I'm sorry for bein born I'm sorry kuma and I'm sorry vj I forgot why I was born I'll kill myself tonight unless a miracle occurs Which won't,but ok I'm sorry vj, if you ever find this, just know that I'm sorry for troubling you My head hurts like fuck#Suicidal_intention
So I've just been feeling extra shitty the last couple of days. I was sitting in my room thinking about killing myself, and then I remembered that my friend told me that she tried to kill herself by hanging herself off her doorknob. So I tried it. Didn't work, just choked a little.#Suicidal_intention
I usually live in another city but since the pandemic, I lost a job and had been camped in my apartment 24/7. I got extremely lonely. I decided to stay with my family until school starts back up. I’ve been here for about a month. I’ve gotten hella depressed since I’ve been here but the thought of going to an empty apartment also makes me want to kill myself. My mom keeps telling me to get a job and I tell her I can’t. I’ve gotten scarred by 2 jobs in the past. I was fired out of nowhere by both. One didn’t even let me finish my shift and didn’t even tell me why I was being fired. It was a humiliating experience because both times I though I was finally starting to get settled in my life. Ever since then, I just can’t bear to work another job. My mom came into my room yesterday and said in these exact words “I don’t want you here”. I’ve always known I was a burden but this just confirms it. I have to kill myself. I don’t even bother anyone here. I just watch tv all day to numb out the loneliness and pain I feel. Everyone’s life would be better if I was dead. Killing myself is a duty I have to commit to. I have no one to turn to. I thought about leaving a suicide note but I feel no matter what I write, it will never fully sum up why I committed suicide. I don’t plan on telling anyone. They’d just try to stop me. Only reason I’m still alive is because I’m finishing season 5 of 24(yes I know it’s an old show, but I never watched it). I honestly just hate my life. I’m still trying to figure out how I’d kill myself. There can be no room for error. This isn’t a cry for help. I want to die.#Suicidal_intention
I think tonight when everyone goes to bed I’m going to kill myself. I just don’t see a reason to keep living anymore.#Suicidal_intention
I am sure when i suicide, all my feelings will fade and it will Just be a feeling of emptiness. I hope i get the courage to do it.#Suicidal_intention
I'm just a fucking burden to everyone. I just make everyone cry because I'm such a fucking shit person. I am done with my life, I can't anymore, I want to kill myself or at least hurt myself#Suicidal_intention
life’s not worth it i’ll never be happy and i’ll never amount to anything or even be able to do anything (significant or not) tomorrow is the day hope i don’t make it out alive#Suicidal_intention
Hello I'm wondering how can i commit suicide but a method thats not hanging myself. I was planning on overdosing but my friend told me that to overdose you need to take large amounts of drugs daily is that true?#Suicidal_intention
I’m getting out of the military next month and I don’t want to plan anything out because honestly I plan on killing myself#Suicidal_intention
I’m struggling with life and work so much right now. I’m feeling the same way I did before when I tried to kill myself by overdosing and it’s scary. I have a bunch of Tylenol that I know will kill me. I’m not afraid of pain, just the fear that I’ll survive with liver damage. I’ve tried everything on my safety plan and nothing’s working. I can’t go to the hospital because if I miss another day at work I’ll be fired. I don’t know what to do.#Suicidal_intention
today has been so hard. i have no reason not to kill myself. my boyfriend who isn’t even my boyfriend wants nothing to do with me, i have no friends, i’m so lonely every single day. nobody knows what goes on and the pain i feel. they just add to it. i hate living, idek why i’m still here#Suicidal_intention
I can’t tell this to anyone I know but I think about hanging myself everyday I just don’t want to fail at it. I see hardly any reason to keep moving forward with my life. Nothing makes me happy anymore.#Suicidal_intention
I just feel so peaceful and ready whenever I think of suicide. But the only thing that's holding me back is my little niece. I'm trying my hardest to live for her but there are days where it's too hard to even hold on. I wanna be selfish and just end my life. I'm too exhausted. It feels like life never been good to me. It's only going downhill. I'm tired. I just want to die peacefully if that's even possible.#Suicidal_intention
I just wanna know the most painless way to commit suicide.#Suicidal_intention
i want to fucking dieeeeeee. i don't want to breathe anymore. i don't want my heart to beat. i don't want all mybrain functions to stop. i want to be dead. is it to much to ask for?#Suicidal_intention
"This has already been the third time. Well, with the first I chickened out, the second- I stopped after realising my younger brother was downstairs. Just now, it worked until the rope snapped. I’m an absolute mess- and it’s not just the physical aftermath. Or so I say and yet here I am typing this out- what am I trying to do at all? Certainly I want to die; rather, simply fold myself out of time and existence."#Suicidal_intention
Guess I’m like a lot of people here kinda waiting for that day of anger and impulse to die. I’ve decided I wanna hang myself I guess can’t really think/find another way to do without my kids finding me. But I’m scared I don’t wanna die but it’s like now I kno there’s no other way out. Even if I have to continue to suffer after death at least I won’t be affecting anyone else in my life. Thank you for showing me the light!!#Suicidal_intention
"I don’t know how to describe the feeling of wanting to die. My name is Jim, a 20-year-old from the Netherlands and I believe that my time has come. My final conclusion is that I’m just lazy. Al my school career I have been doing the absolute minimum to get good grades. I have no passion, no ambition, I’m just a nobody and a nothing. People would describe me as a listener and someone who is full of live, but to be fair, I’m only pretentious. For some time now I have sought for my purpose; what I can be, who I am and I struggle to find answers. The answers I find are that I’m broken, screaming for a fix. I am hurt, unable to break free. I am worthless, slowly drowning in self pity. I thought I’m a fighter, someone who isn’t going to give up, someone who keeps going even when everything turns upside down. However, looking back al I did was running, fleeing from my problems. I am no more than an escapist, running from myself. I care for the people around me. My friends, family and two classmates I hold very dear. But all the time I ask myself what I’m still doing here. I have a feeling that I constantly hurt those around me and I can’t seem to answer wether I’m right or wrong. For three years have I lived with my father and he taught me how worthless I am. Sadly he is just a product of his own abusive history. I am in constant conflict with myself, because I don’t know how much of my pain I can blame on my father and how much is just my toxicity. I lack energy, resolve and passion to do anything. I just have been seeking death for a long time. What does it mean to die? I want to explore that question, maybe that is my passion. If I ever had suicidal thoughts, I’d just push it away knowing that it would cause pain for the people I care. However I think secretly it would relieve everyone. I am toxic, I know it, it has to be, cause I am nothing but garbage. My personality is shit and I cant get a change in it. I think I’m just venting right now while I’m not even getting a point straight in this post. So onto what I actually wanted to write. My chemistry comes in clutch. Yesterday I found out you can easily make a highly effective poison if you know what to buy. This was the laat threshold I needed, because I never wanted to kill myself in excessive means like by train and stuff. I can just sit and die. I’ll write letters to my friends and family saying I’m sorry and that I wished I could’ve fought harder."#Suicidal_intention
I finished my suicide note and I'm staring at my gun. I'm listening to The Weeknd, House of Balloons to be exact. His superbowl performance was amazing the best superbowl performance in my opinion. Too bad I won't be here to see him in concert next year. I go to therapy and I take Prozac but they don't help anymore. I'm too far gone#Suicidal_intention
I fucked up my life. It is entirely my fault. I left umiversity. I permanentely ruined my body (you wouldn'tbelievee stretch marks andd cellullite I have). And this fall is so huge. From being A-student with excellent genetics to a miserable helpless person whith discusting appearance. I haven't been out for months, and even when I just go out of my room to the bathroom or kitchen, I always wear sunglasses and mask. I am turning 18 in a couple of weeks, and I hate myself because of this much more (although, I don't know how is this even possible). The only thing that was stopping me was my family. They will be devastated when I die. Especially, my mom who has a heart condition. It could worsen her health even more. She also tried to kill herself when me and my siblings were little. Msybe, it runs in the family. But now my constant pain is so intolerable that even the lobe of my family isn't stopping me. At this point, I'm just waiting for the day when no one be home for couple of hours. So I couldn't be rescued. I feel so sorry for my family, but I can't live for them anymore. And I won't change my mind, I know it. I feep too empty to fight any longer. So, I guess the next few days will be my last days on Earth. I wonder if there's an afterlife. I sure hope not. Upd: I'm doing it now. I hope I won't survive it this time. I wish you won't end up like me. First time I did it, I felt desperate. Now I just feel sad for tearing my family apart by doing this. I thinj my mom will be broken, and others will be mad at me because of this. But I can't. I just can't. I want to die so badly. I' so sorry. I'm sorry.#Suicidal_intention
I’m not going to kill myself yet. I’m thinking soon though. I just wrote all of my suicide notes. Everything feels so surreal and scary. I don’t know what to do now, I’m feeling so close to death. I’m scared, but I can’t wait until it’s over. I’m so fucking scared#Suicidal_intention
Am going to overdose soon. Goodbye, bastards. see you in hell#Suicidal_intention
This weekend is gonna be 1 year since i’ve been diagnosed with OCD and i’m proud it got a little better. But if we’re talking about depression, social anxiety and panic attacks, well, those are getting worse. I started having suicidal thoughts in march this year and i think i’ll do it soon, so i’m getting ready. I’m tired of fighting my own thoughts. I think it’s time to rest. #Suicidal_intention
I told myself that once I'm finished with the note, that's when I'll make an attempt. I don't know what else to put here, I just don't have anyone to talk to about it. I'm honestly scared, but hopeful. It seems like the method may not be so bad as it sounds. And I honestly can't wait for the burden to be lifted, as scary as it may be.#Suicidal_intention
Today i finally wrote my suicide note, it was sad, but i knew it would happen one day. Im sure of the day im trying to commit suicide, but im scared it'll be painful.#Suicidal_intention
Wrote a suicide note. I typically don't, but theres one friend I care about who knows I'll probably disappear, but I atleast wanted to say some stuff after death. I have a system that allows me to schedule a message, so I could always do that before I do it, and maybe cancel if I survive just so we don't get an awkward moment where I confess a bunch of stuff and I'm still alive. I don't have much to say in it, if I die then peace, I guess. Already tied a sort of noose tight around my neck and with it being held up. #Suicidal_intention
I'm mildly surprised cause yesterday I was feeling really good, but I had a bad morning and suddenly everything came into focus. I have a will, I wrote my note, left stuff for my roommates, and feel like I'm ready to try. I walked out and got myself tacos as a kind of Last Supper thing. Everything feels kinda surreal, but in a good way. TBH I'm still not sure if I'm going to try, but if I was ever going to do it, it's going to be now. I want to fall asleep on some pills and see what happens. Fingers crossed.#Suicidal_intention
Hi All, Thank you for taking the time to read this’d here’s my short and sweet suicide note. So my life has been pretty shit since my teenage days - was bullied In school because I was short calling me words such as shorty, short stuff, midget etc. I was already feeling isolated, dejected lonely - I use to write poems when I was round 17,18 about being lonely, dejected , isolated, dejected - I’ve tried Suisse 3.4 times but was saved in the last moments. I’m 34 years old - never had a girlfriend in my life - I really really want a female companion- I’m fed up of it - I see people around me getting married, have girlfriends, enjoying their life’s. I’m also Asian and there is a lot of jealousy in my family as I’m the only child there is a a lot of stigma attached to it - such as I’m spoilt, I’ll get my parents house etc - I don’t get along with my cousins at all rarely speak to them they in fact me off. Thankfully I’m in a stable job which kind of keeps me sane, I dabble in cocaine once a week - which makes me keep alive . Now I’m ending it goodbye cruel world#Suicidal_intention
I’m done suffering through life with loneliness, no friends, being obese all my life even now after losing weight, trying to build myself up to be the best version of myself. It’s a constant chore. My life is nothing but a mistake. I’ve written my Suicide note and some numbers for the hospital to call so no one will be left in the dark. I can’t motivate or discipline myself to become better, so I’ll just end my pathetic life. A soul that shouldn’t have been brought into this world. I’ll likely end up in hell, but I don’t care.#Suicidal_intention
"You’ll learn to live without me. Like I have to live without you. I can’t continue anymore I have tried to look for help without any success, I seen myself in a world of my own; the person i may call my guardian angel who I could run to in times of troubles is far away, I just have no otherwise! "#Suicidal_intention
I’ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts for the last 17 years or so. I’m 33 now if that matters. Lately I’ve been thinking about it a lot and finally wrote a note for the first time. I struggle big time with dating and being social all my life. I’m just tired of feeling lonely. I’m tired of the struggle. Anyways I’ll end it here.#Suicidal_intention
"I've been so unhappy for such a long time now. I just want to die, now. I think my dog Oliver dying in late February was just the breaking point- the straw on the camel's back. It wasn't always this way. When I think back to my childhood. I remember happy times. Genuine, innocent smiles, and unbreakable positivity. Things weren't perfect, though. I remember being bullied by my older siblings, and later by other children. Since I've always been sensitive, both to other people's feelings as well as my own, this hurt me terribly, and I have never forgiven either of the siblings responsible. I had such a sense of pride, as well. I don't know where it came from, but it was very strong. Since I was a smart kid, I presumed I was better than everyone else my age. I didn't treat them well, and it was a huge error in the long run. Though I had a few friends early on, those that weren't chased off by my nonsense and my sister's attention-seeking antics moved away or else found other people to befriend. I was alone. It's a feeling I know all too well now, to the point where being around others often makes me uncomfortable. My mother was, and is, a drug addict. Slowly she transformed from the person I loved the most, to filth I refuse to even acknowledge as family. I met Steven in third grade. We became best friends for a time, perhaps only two and a half years, until he moved away, but to this day I consider him to be the best friend I ever had. I remember happy times with him. I also remember awful times. Being pelted with rocks, getting beaten up, endless namecalling and mocking. Once he moved, I had no social contacts my age. I started to become somewhat neurotic, probably a sign of my at-the-time undiagnosed autism. Other people my age treated me terribly, and I was frequently mocked and bullied. Things only improved marginally in high school. While the physical attacks had stopped, because I had taken MMA and won a fight, I was still greatly disliked, at least by some, who made it very apparent. I was even spit on from an upper story at school, on Valentine's day. Here, too, were moments of happiness though. I enjoyed learning, and took up Japanese as a second language. I went to little Tokyo in LA many times with my favorite teachers and a small group of weeb students. Even then, though, it wasn't worth it. I was so alone, and hurt. All I wanted was a friend. I never got one. I nearly chose to end my life then, but I made a promise, to stick around and live for my father, the person I love and cherish the most. When I graduated, I did it with honors. Imagine my surprise when, accepting my award, I received a standing ovation from the students... I wasn't hated by them after all, but I was so untrusting of everyone that I never allowed myself to see that. This realization hurts to this day. I was alone and hurting for so long, and it was my fault, completely. In college, things never improved. I couldn't handle the work load, for one. A lifetime of being praised for the minimum excellent work that I did made me lazy. Then came one of the hardest hits. I had to move. The housing trap we lived in was becoming too expensive to stay after 20 years. I was forced to drop out of college, and the movers we chose ended up stealing or destroying most of our things. I lost so much. Despite that being nearly two years ago, it still hurts, like a wound. I am extremely sentimental, and losing these simple belongings hurt me at my core. Shortly after arriving at my destination, in NC, I had to be hospitalized for severe suicidal ideation. I hated it. I made a vow then, to avoid the mental hospital forever. I would try to hide my pain from others, pretend to be fine. Anything to avoid that place. I got a job, worked it for the past year until I fell and broke my ribs. I'm still here. Everything still hurts. I still hate my siblings for the way they treated me, their own little brother. I still hate my sister for driving away my early friends. I still hate my mother, for never being there when I needed her, and for being a narcissistic sociopath. I still hate those that bullied me for so long. Their names and faces are lost to me but their deeds still digging in. I still hate that I never realized how loved I truly was. I still hate everything, and everyone. I love everyone, too. I don't ever want to see another person suffering. The world is cruel though, intentionally. Those in power would not be able to create utopia, but they could make the world so much better and equal and fair and kind, if they collectively chose to. I am so tired. So tired. I am only 22 years old, and I feel as if I have lost everything and everyone. I had dreams, once. They changed as the years passed, until my illusions were finally shattered. I have learned. Dreams, and things like hope, only serve to hurt you. If you consistently hope that things will get better, you will be consistently hurt when they do not. Never forget this. If anyone ever tells you that ""Things always get better."" know that they are one of two things. Either a liar, one who seeks to teach you an untruth, either for good or malicious reasons, or they are delusional. Things don't get better. Never. They only get worse, continuously. Sometimes, it may seem like things are improving. You may doubt these words, think things are finally on their way up. You are wrong. Things only improve in marginal or temporary ways, or as a reaction to something bad occurring. Stay safe, don't hope, don't dream, and certainly don't try. You will only get worse for it, like a divine punishment. I'm still here. I want to die. I want to die so badly. I have not wished to live in so long that I lost sight of why anyone would ever want to live. To live is to suffer, to be hurt over and over and over. There is beauty in life, yes! Love and kindness and nature- animals and plants and fungi of all kinds. Beautiful colors and amazing landscapes. It is incomparable though, to the pain. For every good thing in this world, there must be at least 10 bad. For every pretty bird you see, how many are killed by wild mangy cats we created, or left homeless for deforestation, or simply made extinct? It is hopeless. There is no change or recovery, no way back. If I had my choice, I would have been a miscarriage. No pain, no loss of innocence. Just peace, my mother's heartbeat, and then eternal darkness. Doesn't that sound lovely? I am tired of responsibility, even as simple as chores or simple obligations. Every day I walk home from work, I must force myself to not throw myself in front of a large vehicle. Were I an awful person like my mother, I would have done it long ago. The only reason I do not is because I do not wish to traumatize the driver. They would likely be too weak to end their own life, and thus be trapped with pain as I am. That is the only reason. The promise I made long ago, to live for my father? He, too, has changed. The strong man I once adored has withered into a crippled husk, his chronic pain and many disabilities leaving him in a worse state than I could even imagine. No, he will never be happy, not by any action of mine. If he finds his own happiness somehow, let him have it. I want no part of any of it, of anything at all. I want to be dead. The horrible thoughts that twist through my head repeat themselves, unendingly. I want it to be over. Even sleep is not a respite. There, nightmares and unpleasant memories linger and mix with unwanted fragments of pasts and emotions and smells I had long forgotten about. I want to die. This is not a situation where I hate myself. I was simply dealt a bad hand in life. I hold no ill will towards myself. I do not wish to live anyone else's life either, though. It is too much. I can't take it. Is it that I'm too weak to live in this world, or that maybe there is a happy life for me out there? I don't know. I don't care. I'm so tired. I'm so tired. I want to go home, but nowhere to go back to. All is lost. I'm still here. Every night I daydream of disemboweling myself in the back yard. Sometimes I consider killing my family first, so they won't suffer either. But in the end I never make a decision. I feel like I'm going to snap somehow, to go absolutely mad if I have to endure these ruminating thoughts and memories any more. I miss my dog. I'm typing through tears, and I'm sure none of this even makes sense, but it's how I feel. It's what I think about every single day. I'm so tired. Yes, I am on medication. Yes, I have a therapist. Neither helps. If you made it this far, thank you. I'm sorry."#Suicidal_intention
She's 9 years old, she's so young, and I think I have traumatized her. I have a notebook where I write stupid things and where I draw. I told my sisters it was a private thing and they souldn't touch it. I wrote the letter I decided It was going to be the one I would left when I die in that notebook. The youngest has always been a curious person. Today she told me that she grabbed my notebook and she read my note, she was crying, and she said she doesn't want me to die. I've been feeling like shit for the past year and now I feel even worst. I don't know what to do. I don't know if she is going to feel responsable, or if it is going to damage her in any way. I was planning to hang myself, and now I want to do it even more#Suicidal_intention
Somehow i can’t leave this earth without telling my story, but at the same time i just want to leave and write a note with goodbye and a smiley that’s it. But then the fake woke people are gonna throw lies on my dead body. With “ omg she was always so happy “ I lost my friend” ( the person that never even knew me ) “ Posting pictures of me “ While they never even checked up on me”. Like i really don’t want people to put clout up on my dead body, and only care about me when i’m dead.#Suicidal_intention
I'm beginning to accept that I have to die. I feel like I should write something, because I've heard people losing someone to suicide wishing that there'd been a note. I don't want to put people in a situation where they begin to question everything, as I am going through that now. I honestly feel too tired to write something, but I feel like I should.#Suicidal_intention
I fully plan to kill myself, and when I do, I'm not gonna leave behind some cryptic garbage. People that actually gave a shit about me deserve a reason without having to solve a crossword puzzle. I'm in the worst state of my life#Suicidal_intention
Look at my profile. That is a horrific deformed freak who never belonged here. I never had friends, enjoyed life or even had sex. Every girl who looks at my face thinks “VILE LOOKING CUNT WHO SHOULD DIE” So I am granting them their wish. I will slash my throat right now.#Suicidal_intention
You all know that I’ve waited a long time to do this, and I simply cannot wait anymore. There are a million things that make me miserable, most that will never go away. I can’t take any more of this. I hate going to sleep because it means I’ll wake up, and I don’t like waking up. I don’t want anyone to think I am doing this for stupid and small reasons. I feel that if I do not do this tonight, it is inevitable, so it was bound to happen another time. I sit back and review my life. I thank God for the good parts, but I wish things could have been easier. I can only hope people understand why I am doing this, even if you are angry with me. I’m sorry. Goodbye#Suicidal_intention
I have wanted this for so long, please do not feel sadness or grief that is the last thing that I want. Don't let this change your lives, live your lives to the fullest and make the most out of every day. This world was not made for me, or more accurately, I was not made for this world. Thank you for the time you have spent with me. Some of you made life seem like it was worth living and I can never thank you enough. Mom, dad, Gav I am so so so so so sorry. I am selfish. I tried for so long to be happy for you. I couldn't do it. I couldn't make the pain go away. Please get rid of my stuff. I don't want anyone keeping anything of mine. I don't want anyone to be reminded of me. I simply want to disappear. Please don't remember me. I really don't want to cause anyone pain. There is nothing that could have been done. You were the perfect family. I don't know why I am like this. You forever have my heart.#Suicidal_intention
I feel so hopeless. I don’t even feel anything, I’m numb, empty, hollow. I don’t recognize me anymore. I’m so depressed I don’t want to live anymore. I don’t want to die, but I don’t to live. I wrote three notes, one for my ex boyfriend who I’m still in love with, one for my mom and dad, and one for my sister. I just wanted them to know that it wasn’t their faults, that they couldn’t have prevented what I did. That it was my choice alone. I know that they would be devastated, that I would cause ripples of damage among my family. But I just feel so hopeless. I feel worthless and inadequate, I’m so lonely and isolated. I don’t want to die but I don’t want to live. I don’t care about what happens to me anymore. I just want peace, I just want to stop feeling awful. I don’t know what to do. Nothing works, nothing makes me feel better, I will never feel better. I don’t ever want to feel this pain again. I just want it to end.#Suicidal_intention
I'm done. Done with all this. My life is a dissapointment in all aspects. Im not succesfull in school, social, passion, love. I have not succeded in getting good grades in chess buisness life. Im so dead been suicidal and depressed for 5 yrs and im 16. This pain is destroying me from the inside and i have no talents, no passions, im not attractive im disgusting, and apperantly my personality is worse. Everybody who has invited me feels bad for me. The girl ive been in love with for 2 years the reason im fighting is gone. I expressed my feelings and i apperently easnt her type. Weve been bff for 2 years and weve been so cloe but nah. And now the friendship is gone. All i have is my computer and my games which i apperantly cant get good at even after consistently practising for 3 years. Im still average. I have tried suicide before and i know my mistake. This time il do it the right way and not tell my parents in time to stop me. I am a loser, lazy, ugly, stupid, and weird. I also love complaining like its somebodys elses fault but its mine. Im the problem and im not supposed to be here. I always play the victim to get peoples attention. U see im not worth the worlds resoursces. Im dead now for real this time i am going to cut my whole arm open and die in the hot water.#Suicidal_intention
I don't want to do it but with every passing day it's becoming more and more appealing to end it all. My life is in pieces I hate that I'm suicidal at 17 when only a quarter of my life complete but it is what it is. Fuck school you are the reason why it's happening. So many people contacted me told not to do it and I listened to their advice and tried to turn things around but lo and behold it just got worse this is a bottomless pit I keep going down. I have cried so much I have run out of tears. Human existence is a curse.#Suicidal_intention
Just finished my suicide note,while listening to some peaceful music , I feel so calm about taking my life... Lately my sex addiction has had me doing things that are so out of line with my true self and I've felt so out of control and afraid of continuing to act out- I can't go on feeling out of control like this anymore... I'm tortured by OCD and sexual compulsion and unwanted thoughts day and night... Before I get any worse I need to stop this.... I know this sort of thing doesn't bother everyone but its destroying me inside and I can't do this anymore. Love you all! Take care!#Suicidal_intention
Hi. It's me. I've decided to end my life before my 28th birthday. Don't feel bad. This is what I've always wanted. My whole life I've been feeling like I'm only waiting for the next chapter, and then the next chapter comes and it's never what I pictured. It's always just a little off, enough to make me anxious of what's ahead. Short-lived happiness is always replaced by the ever looming dark clouds, so much so that I've become so used to anticipating how every single thing might go wrong somehow. This is no way to live. For so long this is how I've existed. Clawing my way through the day, albeit exhausted and broken beyond repair. This is no one's fault. Or if it is, then it's probably mine. It's just how I'm wired. I've always found comfort in the knowledge that death is imminent. That I only have a finite number of years left before it's all over and every thing fades to black. Maybe I can't wait that long. Maybe I'm just that tired. I'm tired of waiting for things to get better or for things to be over. So taking matters into my own hands is just about the only option I have. I haven't always been a selfish person. I always put other people's happiness above my own. Heck. I've stayed this long for my parents. Consider this final act me reciprocating and finally doing things for myself. If you're reading this, you're probably one of the very few people who care. So for that I thank you. Thank you for sharing whatever time we had together. Thank you for putting up with me for however long. I'm sorry you had to take the time out of your busy day to read my goodbyes, rather than hearing it from me personally. I'm sorry it was too little too late. For my family. Please get rid of the things that remind you of me. Or keep them, provided they don't cause you too much pain. I'm so sorry to have to burden you with all this. I'm sorry for having wasted your time, your effort, your love. I have never been deserving of any of those, yet still you gave me more than what was required of you. Thank you. And I'm sorry for all the hurt I've caused you. You'll never have to watch me suffer again. Please try to move on. I know it won't be easy, but hopefully, in time, you'll come to realize that I'm finally at peace. I'm so sorry for everything. I love you so much. Now please go and live your life. Forget about this letter. Forget about me. Be happy. I hope you have enough joy in your heart to make up for the lack of it in mine. Goodbye, my loves.#Suicidal_intention
I wish I had another suicide note to write, I suppose this will be my last one. I’m sorry. I simply can’t go on anymore.#Suicidal_intention
I have made a suicide note and just starting reading it for no reason and starting crying soo hard but i dont know what to do i want to die i want to kill my self my parents dont alow me to do anything and life just fucking suks i dont have a safe space and i think im crazy like i see things and hear things and i love blood and i want to know what it feels like to kill some one and i love it when people are afraid or concerned of me i just love it yay i think im crazy but im fine with that and i just want a girlfriend or boyfriend im both ways i just want someone that makes me happy soo pls message me.#Suicidal_intention
I always find myself struggling to write my final goodbyes. It never seems enough. I can never apologize enough. Sometimes I kinda don’t even want to write one. In that moment when I all I can think of is ending all of my pain, I don’t even want to write a note. I just want to grab the gun. I think I’ve finally reached my limit. I just wanted something similar to “happiness” but I feel absolutely nothing. I don’t even know what else to say really. I’m just laying here in my bed. Fantasizing about being happy. Being warm with someone who loves me. There were a few times as a kid I came close to accidentally dying. I wish I died then. At least I had my innocence intact.#Suicidal_intention
I have a suicide note and started looking up buildings with roof access and bridges last night.#Suicidal_intention
Thanks to my friends for loving and taking care of me just know that it isnt anyones fault that i killed myself It was my fault and i just couldnt handle the constant pain and numbness please check on your friends and family.they might have suicidal thoughts or are contemplating#Suicidal_intention
I didn't sent it to him, though I wrote it because I feel like I'm going to suicide very soon. He has tried to help so much and to put it all to waste seems so bad. My self harm urges are so bad and my cuts are getting worse and worse that I feel the only way to make it stop is to kill myself. I haven't had suicidal thoughts in so long, and yet here I am. And this time I feel like I'm actually going to do it#Suicidal_intention
"My name is, if you’re reading this then you likely already know who I am. Some of you may love me and others of you may hate me with all your hearts. But I wrote this to explain why I did what I did. My childhood was great except for a few dark spots; but those dark spots shaped me into who I am. When I was in the 5th or 6th grade, whenever somebody did not approve of me or made fun of me, I just could only think about death. People I was around, including family, sometimes made comments about how I looked or my weight or my height. I never forgot any of those insults, and to this day they still haunt me. I realize that I tend to manipulate and hurt those I am close to, to get what I want. I have never been able to reach the expectations that people set for me, no matter how hard I tried. Whether it be in academics, gaming, sports, or just even as a person; I was never able to achieve that sense of fulfillment. When I got into high school, I thought maybe I would reinvent myself and change how people saw me. This worked. For a little while though. In the 10th grade, things were going well for a while until they did not. There was a whole lot of drama that occurred that I won’t go into detail about, but long story short, I lost many friends and felt alone and like I was a terrible person. By my junior year, I was not invited to any parties or any social events, I had basically no friends, except for the ones I had in my classes that I occasionally talked to. Not only that, I also enrolled in Running Start full time to get away from my high school but that only worsened my depression. I was a 3 - 4 student all throughout my middle school career and my high school career as well, up until that point. I was so depressed that I wouldn’t have the social energy to talk to people or study or do anything for that matter. I got good at putting up a façade so that people around me didn’t know I was depressed. This brings me to my senior year, I had no friends at this point and due to my poor performance in my junior and senior year, I got waitlisted to the only school that I imagined going to: The University of. I eventually got in, but I was a wreck when I didn’t. Moreover, I had a lot of problems socializing, especially with girls I was interested in. They would typically reject me, and I’d respond in sort of a gaslighting fashion, I now realize. Because of my lack of self confidence due to all of these factors, I was very sexually and romantically depressed and I got desperate; searching for ways to date on the internet or sliding into the DMs of girls I knew or had mutual friends with. These attempts would all crash and burn as I was not good at it. Many girls would find me creepy as I had very direct approaches when it came to sexual things. This led me to hate myself further. In my freshman year of college, I turned to dating apps and to social medias of fellow classmates to try and find a romantic relationship. None of these would yield any dates as well. With COVID-19 and school becoming overwhelmingly stressful and I developed severe depression and had many anxiety attacks every day. I eventually went to see a therapist as well as a psychiatrist and I started recovering over time. But doing this also got me a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Over the summer after my freshman year, I discovered that there was an NSFW side of Twitter. I then joined and met this one girl who I really liked, she won’t be named, but we eventually began dating on the 1st of September 2020. Our long-distance relationship was going pretty well, but we had some bumps mainly due to my mental health issues, which caused us to take a break. Even though we were on a break, we were still basically dating. Around the end of January, I was going through a lot of things, including school, health, and family. I told her about what was going on and she seemed accepting of it. She became distant and I confronted her. She told me she didn’t want to be around me, and she told me that she met someone new, and we basically stopped talking. I realize now that I was manipulative and may have gaslighted her and that is on me. When we broke up, I didn’t know how to handle it so I tried to contact her many different times to try and patch things up and she basically blocked me and rejected my attempts. I became very sad and as an attempt to console myself, I began looking to different online forums such as Discord servers and I did meet someone I actually really liked though they lived in another continent from me. I began to feel better, but things would not stay that way. My great grandmother passed away who is very dear to me and my family, so that hurt a lot. Being around death and sadness just makes you think about all the things you’ve done and how and when you will die. That passed and I began feeling better, but then my uncle, which was my dad’s best friend growing up, passed away suddenly. This prompted me to try and get back with my ex and she shot me down in a major way that hurt me a lot. I forgot to mention that I vented to people who I considered my friends about my breakup. I felt that my ex cheated on me, and that hurt me a lot. One of my friends talked to her about it and made me feel that it was all my fault, which I didn’t feel was true, but I still believed it. With all of this stuff going on; doing poorly in school, losing friends and relationships, and people dying around me, I began to reconsider my life and what it is really worth. This is what led me to this moment, writing this specific note. I have decided to end my life because I can’t endure any more of this suffering and pain, as well as pain I inflict on others. I decided that the best course of action is to kill myself, and end all of this. Goodbye, to those I knew, and to those who knew me. With much love"#Suicidal_intention
To my dear mother: I have decided to voluntarily take my own life. I am making this decision solely because I love you too much. I adore you to such a degree that I cannot bear to exist knowing that, by living, I risk the possibility of hurting you. I love you so much that I am willing to perish for your happiness. I am sorry that I never became the woman you wanted me to be. I was doomed to fail from the start. I do not deserve the sacrifices you make for me. In order to take responsibility for me for the mistakes I know I am bound to repeat, I should no longer be allowed to exist as a blemish on the face of this earth. I am confident that you can find happiness once I am gone. I hope for this to be the last time I should ever cause you to bear yet another burden, and I apologize for the life I've lived as such an inconsiderate child. I hope that my death will be forgotten shortly after I am gone. I pray that my erasure from this planet will be as hideous and painful as possible to match my ugliness as a person and the pain I have continuously caused others. Please don't attempt to dissuade me from doing this, I wish to waste away in my melancholy alone and spare you the heartache of raising me.#Suicidal_intention
Hey Reddit, first time posting here but, I’m over it, everything feels fake and idk what to do anymore, I think I might try to end it again, I cut myself A lot to punish myself for ruining my teen years, there is nothing for me in the adult world, and idk what exactly to do anymore, I love my boyfriend to death (forgot to mention I’m a girl(20) I want to go, I need to go, nothin has felt real in my life, always felt like I was always impersonating someone else, I’m incapable of being my own person, I’m just what everybody else wants me to be,none of it feels like me, when I look in the mirror I don’t see me, I see a shell, I feel trapped, I don’t want to go to the hospital, I don’t think I want help anymore, I just want to die, but I’m such a pussy abt it ? Idk, but the worst part is that idk how to say good bye, I don’t have any affairs to get in order bc I haven’t started to get affairs in the first place, I stopped going to college on the account that I am scared of debt, and due to my mom fooling with her taxes I can’t get fasfa, and I’m smart in the way that I can regurgitate facts that I’ve been told but as far as math or anything else I’m as dumb as a bag of rocks, so no CS degree for me, I tried getting a job with healthcare that will pay me to go to school but it’s America so you need a degree for a job where the only thing you do is just to pick up a phone, I’m tired, I don’t want to live on this rotten planet anymore, not bc of the college thing but bc I have overstayed my welcome, I wake up everyday and feel expired, and idk how to tell my family this or my boyfriend, I don’t want to hurt him, but I’m sure he’ll find someone else, I’m only posting here bc I don’t think I can take much more of this, self harm isn’t getting me anywhere or makes me feel like it use to, I use to feel like I got what I deserved and I need to be good in order for it not to happen but now I feel like I need it in order to feel like I’m alive, I don’t know how to put it in words to them, bc ain’t no way I would want them to read all this like you all are, I just am putting this here in case I do kill myself, I’m scared to die but I’m also sick of living, ironic isn’t it ? But I hope death is exactly the way that I think it is, as I bleed out I just lose my senses one by one until nothing, I hope it’s that peaceful,anyways I hope you all make it out bc I’m not sure what’s gonna happen,we all gotta die some time right ?#Suicidal_intention
Two nights ago, I wrote up what I wanted my family and friends to see when I die. I cried the entire time. Tonight, I’ve decided that I’m going to do it. I don’t see a purpose in going on anymore. I feel like such a burden on the lives of those around me. I’m emotional dead weight and they shouldn’t need to carry me around anymore. I’m not sure why I’m writing here. I don’t know what responses I expect to see. I hope my family and my friends will be okay. I don’t want to hurt them but in the long term things will be better for them.#Suicidal_intention
"i don’t know how to write a suicide note. i’ve done it so many times it’s almost like routine, following a similar script each round. i don’t know how to be poetic when it comes to my own demise, and for that i am sorry. i’m sorry all that these notes have is a list of “sorry’s” and “i love you‘s”; i mean them, but they don’t do much but sound redundant. they don’t have quite the same impact beyond the grave, because all you’ll be wondering is “if you’re sorry, and you love us, why did you do this?” i don’t know the answer to that. i mean i can probably think of a lot of reasons why, but none of them would be satisfying. the truth is i wasn’t built for this life. there’s no place for me on this earth. i don’t fit in anywhere. that’s a lesson i’ve learned time and time again. i feel so much pain, so often. it’s like all that’s ever mattered is trying to get away from the pain but i’ve come to learn it’s inescapable. there is no way out of this spiral. it’s just sadness all the way down. misery, numbness, wishing i was born-as-a-fucking-cat sadness. i don’t know how i’ve stood on this unstable foundation for so long, that i’m just now going to break through and fall beneath, return back to the earth, cease to exist, once again i will be part of nature. think of me when you look up at the night sky and see it illuminated with stars, think of me when you smell pine needles dampened with rain. i will be all around you, if you just know where to look. if i were to tell you that i didn’t plan for it to turn out this way, i’d be lying. i’ve known my destiny for years. it’s all just been a matter of when. but things have gotten so hard lately, i think it must be time. my ticket for this show has expired. i wish i could stay longer but it’s much too hard. you’ll be okay without me. you won’t think you will, when it first happens, but time heals. you’ll grow to realize you did all you could, i just had to make my own choice. i wish i could tell you i’m sorry after the fact, and i will try, whenever i go, to let you know i’m listening to you. i will be around in the air, in the trees, in the soft crashing of ocean waves, you’ll hear me again. not with your ears, but with your heart. i’ll be there. so, i’m sorry to end the last “conversation” we’ll ever have, rather, the last words you’ll hear from me in their rawest form, but writing more wouldn’t help you come to terms with it, anyway. so this is goodbye, and i love you. with all of my heart. don’t you ever forget how much i cared. thank you, for everything."#Suicidal_intention
I finished my suicide note last night, I don’t know what happened. I had a great night at the start but my mood went from 100 to 0 in 10 minutes. I know people care about me, but it feels like anything I do will disappoint them. I’ve tried anti depressants and therapy but it just feels like nothing works regardless of how hard I try. I’m able to maintain a full-time job and have meaningful social connections, I even used to exercise every day. I feel like it’s gotten to the point where I can’t manage them anymore. I feel selfish for wanting to die but I also feel selfish for living because I’m just a drain on everyone, and they all want me to succeed but I can’t do it anymore.#Suicidal_intention
“I’ve always found it funny how love is so valued in our society. For many it’s the only goal, it’s the thing you get out of bed for, it’s the reason you leave your house, it’s why you smile at the barista and wave good morning to a fellow jogger. Most people live for the hope of love. Sure they have other aspirations. They want a good career and a comfortable amount of money but above all they want happiness and they want someone to share it with. I never found much hope in happiness. It’s fleeting and it leaves behind a bitter taste when it’s gone. It can’t ever continue forever because if joy was eternal then there would be no joy. As far as love goes I find it’s just another word for goodbye. I’ve never said “I love you” and meant it. I spent my whole life terrified to admit that. I thought if I was different I’d be crucified and colored heartless. Now that it’s all to come to an end I can finally say I’ve never loved. It’s just a phrase another sequence of meaningless words floating out into an endless void. I used to tell myself there must be some reason people never stop searching but the truth is there isn’t. We dedicate our whole lives to a sea of broken promises and damaged dreams and then we die. For so long I tried a little harder every day to be ok and every night my eyes got a little duller. Eventually they just went dark. They cast a shadow over everything that was and would ever be. I was born too broken for this world. Maybe once I was ok but I can’t recall it’s too distant too far away. I’d like to think that people will miss me when I’m gone but the truth is anyone who sheds a tear couldn’t possibly know me. They won’t miss me they will miss the idea of me. I spent my whole life hiding and even now I am hiding. I’ll die never having shown a single human who I truly am. I’d say I’m sorry for that but I’m not because no one deserves the true burden of me.”#Suicidal_intention
For years now it had just been a thought in my mind, but physically dividing up my possessions and writing apologies was never anything I saw myself doing. Today was the first time. I just don’t have any hope left. I tried telling people close to me, I tried reaching out and asking for help, just today I told my boyfriend I was in a dark place and really needed someone to just sit with me and hold my hand and he said no. He wouldn’t come into the other room to hold my hand because he said he “wasn’t in a physical affection mood.” Then he disappeared all day, came back, passed out drunk. I’ve just been alone staring at my bottle of pills all day. I really tried to do everything right. I’m genuinely sorry that I’ll be disappointing my family: I know I had a decent amount of potential since I’m only in my mid-twenties. But my anxiety is too much and honestly I don’t have the money to fix my mental health. I don’t have the energy to either. I don’t have a set date yet, but at least I figured out what I want everyone to know when I’m gone and where I want my cats to go.#Suicidal_intention
I have a history of almost successful attempts, I am alone at home for at least another week and I am again in that wired mood that strikes me almost every time before I attempt. Usually it just goes away after binge drinking but it’s just sitting there, getting worse.life which for a moment was okay just kinda getting worse and worse , support systems failing. Family and friends are increasingly on the no talk list. I am again planning my last meal and this time nothing is stopping it, no obstacles, no short term goals. Everything is just kinda on the track with lots of coal heading towards death. Fuck I hate how basic depressed#Suicidal_intention
So umm, idk why I'm writing this shit but I've been feeling shit for last 'bout 12 years and 9-10 of those I've been suicidal af And last month has been the worst of them and I've tried to seek help from the only people I trusted, just got dumped away for oversharing and cut my ties with the rest.. So umm, I've planned to end it all with cyanide using (to not let others have the idea to use the thing to kill themelves) but that shit was out of sale rn, so I figured out I'll just get fuck ton of booze, get my rope and blades with me, took my notebook too, wrote my letter, and will end this as soon as I'm drunk enough to not bee too afraid of failure#Suicidal_intention
I have a lot to say and I want people to know suicide is really just a rational response to a fucked up world and there's nothing crazy about it. I wanna divide it into sections of things that happened in my particular life that led to me killing myself, another section on how fucking clueless society is about suicide and how 99 of what people say to help is utter bullshit and only pushed me closer. Then another section of why I think the world isn't worth living in anyway and I don't understand why everyone doesn't kill themselves. I think at this point life is only about being a worker bee, you have to work to survive and that's the most important thing in life whether you admit it or not. And that's all still to barely have enough scraps to survive and still spend eternity in debt. There's nothing to live for, we're born, live and die to make other people rich and that's it. The greatest act of rebellion I think is suicide. It's telling the world I will NOT be a cog in your machine, I will not keep my mouth shut and accept the status quo, and I won't accept your insistence that I have to stay alive no matter what, that's only rooted in needing endless cheap labor. Wanna write one last thing, have absolutely nobody asking a single question about why I did it, what I felt, or why they might as well do it too. I imagine it'll be long and ultimately rambling bullshit but once that's done I guess I'll probably post it places and then finally be free from the rat race and finally embrace the void and the nothingness of death#Suicidal_intention
i can’ t do it, I won’t, cloudy took over me.I already attempted suicide one because of her.That didn’t work because wanted to make me suffer longer.That bastard.She took all my happiness away and threw it in the trash.The last thing I’ll see is clouds.A great reminder..great.Just, GREAT. She insulted me behind my back and NEVER apologized, made my friend ghost me, and broke a lot of my serious friendships (manipulating them to insult me and be mean to me too.)she tore my heart apart and she watched it burn while I was crying.I cried.Cloudy, if you see this on the news, you have lost me and all my respect for you.You will never be forgiven for your horrible acts and they are irresponsible. And so many people SUPPORTED you and our choices.You say it was MY fault but I WASN’T ASKING TO BE INSULTED, YOU DID IT YOURSELF.IT WAS YOUR CHOICE ONLY, CLOUDY, YOUR CHOICE ONLY.People said you were never mean to me.You whispered and privately insulted me behind my back so I screamed. I screamed so much that my throat hurt for a week.You wanna know how long I screamed?I screamed so goddamn much that my neighbors came over.Words HURT cloudy, and forcing my friends away and manipulating them into talking and mocking me will make me hate you even more.You’e the reason I cry in bed, cloudy.You know, Lia just looked me right in the eye when you asked me if I was there, she said no, then they laughed and I burst into tears and screamed. I hope you see this.I know you won’t cloudy.I know it.You never cared about me .I realized that.You only wanted to insult me and mock me.I hate June 27th.It doesn’t matter if it’s an important day , I will continue to attempt suicide on that day.And it’s coming up.If you have any words cloudy, it’s already too late.you’ve ruined my life.You’ve made me go too far deep. Goodbye forever cloudy.Oh, and one last Thing. I hope that you burn.#Suicidal_intention
I will be dead next month on my next payment. Im 20years old and im already waiting to die but cant wait any longer. I dont care if you think im to young. I know how this world works better than anyone. All what matters is looks money and status the rest is superficial bullshit. im a short guy but not only am i blackpilled but i had to endure years of torment being in school. I was nearly raped in primary school at luton. I never mentioned this. i have zero freinds, this is because they mock me for multiple things such as being so short in height for being to quite and introverted. Most of these issues ive dealt with for a long time. Im so exhausted and i never asked for life. Life picked me and to be honest with you. Its pretty much suffering on a daily basis with meaningless things that occupies us daily. We eat we sleep we work we repeat. Making friends is hard for me becuase of serious issues i have in my head. I have psychotic depression. Ive been in psychiatric wards. I dont like to talk to people and dont plan on it either. Therapy is a waste of time in my opinion, they are there to be paid to listen to you. the worst thing about my life is that im at rock bottom and theres no way out. you just struggle everyday without enjoyment. Playing video games was fun for me but now its like therapy to keep my mind of the negative things. I hate people with a passion for their ignorance and narcissistic behaviours. I look at others who dont deserve a good life for the horrible things they have done. If life is not fair then why should i not take life for granted. I did a 2 year course in where i was expected to come out with good results and i flopped it because of coronavirus. Which has pushed me to the edge. I just hope next time when a couple decides to bring a child into existence they will care about how the child will not only LOOK but how healthy it will be and the potential they can give it. Some people are evil for bringing children into this world. Who wants bad genetics brought on by parents just be ridiculed by the masses of people you come in to contact? No one. Well thats what ive felt like. Goodbye this is my first and final post.#Suicidal_intention
I have come across a suicide note that I wrote a couple years ago. It's crazy how so much of this note still remains true. I could honestly use the same note to commit suicide today and it would work. I truly wish I would've just followed through with it a couple years ago when I wrote because it would've saved so much more heartache and suffering. I just need to get a couple more things in order so that they don't affect my family and then I fully plan to end this pathetic joke of a life. I'm tired of fighting depression and anxiety. I'm tired of the heartaches. I'm just tired of everything. Nothing will help and I know it. I truly want to be dead.#Suicidal_intention
theres not really much to say , i dont have a single clue of what im even going to say. all i ask is that you only blame me and me only. i was the weakest person i ever knew, and i let everyone down. sure, therapy , meds, all of that, i tried getting better but that never seemed to work out after like five years. i wanna stop being a burden to everyone ive ever met and the only way i think i know how is to end it all. the biggest roadblock is to find a way to kill myself and not feel pain, something quick and painless and sure, maybe i deserve the most painful death imaginable, but i am selfish and just wanna sleep forever peacefully. medication, endocrinology appointments with this medication and injections , and parents always fighting every once in a while, since i was young. i wanna be cremated and probably dumped somewhere , maybe the sea. or you could do whatever u want , i just personally think that i am hideous and would be worse looking dead. i am only 17 years old but i can say that i wish i was never born. music probably kept me here long enough before i just gave up. love, money, materialistic things, time, etc. i wish i could give my life to someone who really needed it instead of it being wasted on me. im just ungrateful and my family was always there. sometimes that did not help much, but whatever. maybe games and the internet and my phone really did kill me. maybe parents just thought so. i give up to be honest. i just want to die. i wish i successfully and painlessly took my life. this whole world is absolutely disgusting. filled with so much evil.. wheres god when u need him? i honestly couldnt believe in that stuff. child rapists and wars and so much violence and despair in this world, i dont want to be part of a world where people die every day, and some few own everything. thats all besides the point. i am sorry for everything. im sorry for not being good enough, or strong enough. give all my shit to my little brother i guess. please dont check my phone and shit, that was all personal info, i really dont want people looking at stuff like that when gone. remember me when i was happy. well i guess i dont have a say in anything if im dead. im sorry and to those i loved , im always thinking of you. lets hope we meet again#Suicidal_intention
I won't bore you with why I've come to this place after years of struggle depression and medications . Yesterday I heard someone laugh on the street and it was such an alien sound I stopped and stared. Please to whatever God is listening let my final moments be quick. I have been so lonely, numb and deeply sad that I don't even know what it means to be a normal human. I've forgotten. Like I've become a new raw version of my self. But I do want to name someone who pushed me over . You my boss. You know what you did. You just don't care how humiliated and threatened you make me feel everyday . You were the nail in my coffin and I hope you rust and fester in your own hate. You won. I hope you're happy. I have nothing to give , because I have nothing left except regret. That and the pills I take to dull my brain every night to face another day. I have made a choice for this to be over. My family, please don't cry for me. Throw my things out. And please spend the rest of your life happy. Let me go.#Suicidal_intention
I have so many things to say, and i think itll be documented well in there. It's on private right now. Once i am ready to commit suicide, i will deactivate all my social media accounts and publicize it instead. Sure, my friends do know that im suicidal but they only know the surface. Nobody knows other than my friends. I used to write in my google keep notes but those were too disorganized. I dont have the eneergy to summarize what ive been experiencing, since theres just too much to say and im really bad at explaining so i hope that that twt acc will help for my family and friends to know a little bit of my reason. I dont know if they will read all of it, maybe theyll get bored. Im starting to plan my suicide. Maybe i'll do it next year, or this year. Depends on my mood and triggers. Im so overwhelmed from everything especially in school. I know school isnt everything, but it kinda is to me. Excelling in it is the only thing im good at. If i fail this semester, thats it. Im done. I'll go.#Suicidal_intention
Idk how to put my feelings into words but growing up in a toxic family is so messed up. I don't have anyone here in our house to talk to because they all hate me. I won't forget the day when mom told me that she regrets raising me and that she should've continued the abortion. Before you judge me, I already told my parents that I'm suicidal years ago, but they just told me that I lack faith in God and I should go to church instead of feeling sad all day. I don't feel like I still have a role in this world aside from paying my parents' debts. I always considered commiting suicide ever since I was in 7th grade but I thought I should help my family first. As I am writing this, I have the rope ready. I'm having a second thought whether I should end my life tonight or live. There's no reason for me to live because I have nothing and no one to lean on, however I still value my life a little. I actually wrote a suicidal note for them so they would know how much shits I've been through but I threw it away because who cares about me, right? Idk if I'll survive tonight, wish me luck#Suicidal_intention
I’ve been planning on killing myself for a while and I think I will do it soon. But I was just wondering about people’s opinions on leaving notes? The thought of writing them causes me even more pain, but the thought of my loved ones being in pain also destroys me. If it were you, what would you do? Would it upset people more or help them get closure? I just want to make sure I cause the least possible damage to others in my life when I go.#Suicidal_intention
If you're reading this, then I have taken my life. I don't blame anyone for what I've done. No one is responsible for this but me. If you're wondering why I did what I did, then imagine you're falling down a deep dark hole with no end in sight. That's how I felt, every day, every minute, every second. I felt trapped in this world. Something I learned in a my short time in this world was that everyone is selfish. I tried so many times, I tried so much to reach out to people around me, for help. They tried to help too, those who care about me. But after a point they were fed up. In the end everyone just thought how my illness and behaviour is affecting them, how it's torturing them, emotionally blackmailing them, no one thought about what I'm going through and how hard it is to come out of this. My family, my girlfriend, my friends all abandoned me because my illness was taking a toll on their own mental health. Maybe I was selfish too, I tried in whatever way I could to make myself happy, to get out of this, but maybe somethings I did were selfish. I hurt those who loved me when I was alive and maybe those people are going to get hurt again when they read this. But I was left with no choice, no one to turn to, and nowhere to go. Goodbye.#Suicidal_intention
I feel no emotions. I have nothing inside me. 8 months back I use to love myself and had ambition in life but now nothing. I have always suffered from depression but I thought I was feeling fine now. After 5 years that is. I fell in love with someone. I really really cared about her. We were amazing tbh. But suddenly she started saying that she had to go because I was tying her down. I was going through some tough times so I needed her support. Guess I was asking too much. All I need someone to hug me and say I care about you and I am someone you can call me your own. I always had a harf time gitting in. Always thought I'll be a loner and outsider. But with her I didn't. We had alot of quarrel for a week or so. Ultimately she blocked me. My parents were so scared they called her. I lost control of my emotions and did a lot of bad things. I am an awful person. I have no true good friends . I belong nowhere. I have become apathetic. I am just a shell of someone I use to be. What is my purpose ? Who am i? These questions are constantly pondering me. I want to return to being the person who always seeked beauty and was happy the way he was. Loved himself. Now my whole life is about to crash. Idk what to do. I have fought harf for last 5 months. Numerous suicide attempts . But now I am just tired. I have no money to see a therapist . Nothing. All I am is tired . Although I don't feel anything. But I feel pain. Pain and only pain. I live a loveless life now. I will end it today . I am free enough to get some catharsis. I am free enough to choose when I die.#Suicidal_intention
Here I am writing my suicide note while balling my eyes out. And how the fuck can I kill myself when I know how much it will hurt my mom. She loves me so much and I don’t wanna hurt her but I can’t live with this constant pain anymore#Suicidal_intention
Just need some help with the means i could do it with? Pills or hanging? I don't want it to hurt much. Why am i doing this?...well i haven't been given a chance to choose my birth..I'll atleast die on my own terms.#Suicidal_intention
Does writing a suicide note make it more likely that you want to actually do it? After watching a medical programme that featured the after effects of suicide, for those left behind was the not knowing why. It seemed practical to me to write a note even if did not plan to end it there and then. Have revised it a few times since but not deleted it. One of the main reasons I have not done it is can't find a definite way that would be 100 successful and did not involve others.#Suicidal_intention
I'm committing suicide tonight. Though I know this is the best choice for me, I feel bad that I'm hurting my family and those that I care about with my decision. Is there anything I can put in my suicide note to reassure them that it's not their fault and I loved them?#Suicidal_intention
No one in my real life will care so I won't leave anything for them. But maybe someone here will care. I'm meaningless, and my death will be meaningless, it won't even cause anyone any pain, but I'd like someone to at least know why I'm about to shoot myself in the head. I'm tired of living. I don't remember ever being happy, not once, and I don't believe it's possible for me to ever be happy in the future, so it's just better if I die. This is my choice, and I'm at peace with it. #Suicidal_intention
"This world is not meant for me. I am not meant for this world. I will miss it nonetheless. I've decided it will be best to just end it. I yearn for the feeling of my blade cutting and slicing through my throat and wrists. I'm sorry I was never enough. I think it would be nice to die at exactly midnight, the hour of nothingness and darkness. Only 1 hour and 16 minutes till then. I think I will end this with a quote from my favorite poet. ""I became insane with horrible intervals of sanity."""#Suicidal_intention
How long did it take you to notice I was dead? weeks, or maybe even months? Did you even notice, or did a neighbor complain about the smell coming from next door of my corpse rotting away? Yeah, that is part of the problem on why I did it. None of you cared. Nobody cared. I'm completely alone. You cant say that isn't true. I really haven't spoken to anyone in months, I get more conversation with the grocery and parcel delivery guys. I'm sure you all can carry on, as usual, me being dead makes not a blind bit of change or difference to your lives, and you know that's true. I found some calm in writing it, but I still have dark thoughts of hanging myself off the upstairs banister.#Suicidal_intention
I don’t know when I’m going to muster up the courage to do it, but I think it might be soon. No one really seems to care about me, so I might as well just get it over with. Even people who reach out to me on Reddit ghost me because I’m probably just awful. I wrote out everything I needed to say, and I’m happy with what I wrote. I just want everything to be over.#Suicidal_intention
Hello guys ,just to clear something- im getting all the treatment possible for my illeness . The pills i ordered and gonna overdose with are on the way , i would like to draft my suicide note because honestly its the last thing i gonna leave so i need to get it right. I know im gonna hurt my friends but i sure as hell wont stay alive to not hurt them (harsh truth)#Suicidal_intention
I know I’m going to die from suicide, and the way things are going probably within the next month. I’m 15 and I have nothing left to live for, I haven’t felt happy in ages. The only thing stopping my are my peers. They’re some of the only people who treat me well. I don’t want to hurt them, but I don’t know if I can take it much longer.#Suicidal_intention
"I can no longer bear the emotional burden of everyday life. Everyday is a bad day. I no longer feel any emotional stability at home. I'm constantly being dragged on a rollercoaster that is spiralling out of control. My parents argue everyday constantly. I always feel afraid; I am walking on eggshells. The tiniest crack and suddenly I get screamed abuse at. I'm always brought into arguments and even if I don't agree with something, I'm forced to side with one over the other. I feel strained, emotionally and physically. I could no longer bare the constant stress. I hate my life. Not because I lack clothes or objects, but because I don't have any emotional support from my parents whatsoever. I can't even tell someone, even my best friend Grace, because If I do, it will only end up even worse. I would bare it until I'm 18, it's only 4 more years, but I would be stupid to think I will be allowed to achieve my dreams. My father is forcing me to leave school early, skip university and to get an apprenticeship to become a chartered accountant. Not only that, but to do it through my auntie (his sister). I hate the whole idea, but in the end, I know there's no way out. For the rest of my life, he'll control everything. I'm going to hate it and one day I'm going to end it. So why not just end it now? Why go through all that pain and hopelessness everyday, when I can just end it now? I would rather not live any life than a life I hate. I'm sorry if you still don't understand why I did this. Maybe one day you'll understand why I did what I did. Maybe not. All that matters, is that I know why I did it. There was only one exit out. I just walked through the door. If I thought you would change, I would've told you everything. This was not a rushed decision. I've been thinking this for years. Bye Grace. I truly loved you like a sister. I'm sorry I didn't tell you everything. Just know, there was nothing you could do so never feel bad. Goodbye. It doesn't matter how far I travel from your lives, just know that I will always love you. We were the right people, we just met at the wrong time. Goodbye "#Suicidal_intention
"""Sorry"". It's gotten to the point where all the grief and sadness I would inflict on others in killing myself, and I can't even muster up more than a word now to leave them with. Every time I go to the bathroom, especially when taking long showers, I always think about how that's where I want to die. How I wished I had a gun, how I'd clear all my electronics, and how I'd schedule texts to be sent so that my body isn't discovered decomposed. What was once a whisper of suicidal thoughts now feels like a constant, loud droning. I get more and more tired every day. I just want to sleep."#Suicidal_intention
I want to get it 100 my suicide. No holding back on my love or hate. To get that rope warm cos im killing myself on my birthday 21st#Suicidal_intention
I'm fairly certain my life is going to end with suicide. I'm not sure when I'll do it but I know I will at some point. Right now I'm too much of a coward. That being said, I want to be prepared for when I do get it done. Should I write a suicide note? Should there be just one or one for each person that matters to me? Should I write one to the people that made my life worse? How does this work?#Suicidal_intention
I’ve been psychologically and emotionally abused by most of my family since the age of 7. My mom married an awful man who physically assaulted me (24F) and is facing charges, but my mom is trying to gaslight me once again and has chosen him over me. I wrote a suicide note that came from the heart but it’s so honest and contradictory to what my mom wants me to believe that I think me killing myself and leaving that note would only cause my family to hate me more than they already do. I want to send it to her on the off chance she’ll finally see my pain but when I told her I was suicidal a few years ago she told me she couldn’t help me and that she felt I was just trying to get attention. My dad killed himself and she said she tried to help him and it didn’t work so she had to distance herself from me for when she got the call. I have like 2 friends and am so emotionally fucked up that I don’t want to try to make more. My family either agrees with my mom that I’m a “problem child” or some just don’t see how awful it is. Guys like me until I can no longer pretend to be perfect and things at work are going to hell quickly. If I didn’t have a cat that I love more than life, I’d be gone tonight.#Suicidal_intention
A few days ago I found out I may be psychically going to school in about a month so I'll soon be able to leave the house and go through with my suicide plan. This isn't the only suicide note I'm going to write, theres a couple more. I know it isn't a few going to happen for the next few weeks but I want it all to be planned and ready to go. I need to make everything about this suicide plan perfect and making sure I have everything I want to say in the suicide notes is one of those things. I've been planning this for a bit now, it was just thought back in July but I didn't make it a proper plan til the start of August.#Suicidal_intention
Long or short? Would a long note prolong the pain, forcing them to read it, or would a short note not be long enough to cover everything? What would you say personally? What should I do or say to cover all bases? I'm not entirely sure if this is allowed on this sub or not and if not I'm totally okay with it getting removed. I'm going to try to kill myself either way but I'd rather do it in the best way possible than have it be a horrible mess, both literally and emotionally, so I figured I could try to get help on this note.#Suicidal_intention
im going to kill myself, and i want everybody to know, i was abused and had a shitty life, i tried to hide it for a long time and i tried to entertain people like a clown. everytime i tried to make people laugh, people spitted on my face and i kept smiling. i cant stand living anymore. everytime i breathe, it hurts more. i have to end it. im sick of entertaining other people. goodbye.#Suicidal_intention
"I lost the last of my vision back in Juli 2018, due to surgery complications, so now programming (my big passion and life for the last 8-10 years) feels so empty and unfulfilling. My dad died a day after his 60th birthday (of canser) and I should have been there (and I was offered to stay the night, something I declined because I wanted to go ""home"", because I'm selfish). My dog died just under a month later because of stuff in his stomach (either canser or stuff he's eaten). I hatte my body I'm not in a relationship and the unspoken presure from my family to find a gf is to much weight to handle. I'll never find a gf (or anyone that wants a physical relationship with me) because I'm uggly. I'm still a virgin. Every time I try to get into a relationship with a girl (not even physical) they either just friend zones me or ghosts me all together. Every time I see my extended family they always ask me about when I'm going to start uni, or make subtle remarks about me not ""doing anything"" and it's hard to hear BECAUSE I'M FUCKING STUCK. If you're reading this. It mean that I lost the battle. That I've set out to join my Dad in the afterlife (hey, maybe I'll get that beer we never got to have as father and son, under the warm sommer sun). That I've realized that I'm never going to be happy, that I was going to die single without ever beeing in a relationship with anyone, that my visionlos was to hard to handle on my own (which I have had to do). We are all going to die at some point. I just can't take more of this life (I can't remember who said it but, ""everyone has to die, I want to choose the time and place"")."#Suicidal_intention
Please don't be sad. I'm happy now. My life is a sham. I push everyone away and I don't deserve love. This is a decision that I chose for myself. I believe that life is what you choose to do and if you choose to end it then that's your choice. I've never felt like I make my own decisions. I only do things to make myself look better in the eyes of other people. I'm done doing that. I chose to do this because I wanted to. Not because of other people making me do this. I want to die, but the only reason I keep on living is for other people. I chose to die because I wanted to. Because I wanted to. I wanted to die so I chose to die. Not because of anybody else. I'm sorry that I'm going to make people sad but I didn't do this for them. I did it for myself and myself only. I chose to die because I wanted to. Because I wanted to.#Suicidal_intention
Dear people What is life ? I've been questioning everything for a while now I was a happy child, always dreaming to grow up but I didn't know what was going to happen. My sky is filled with dark clouds, no sun no moon no stars no anything the dark clouds are opaque. All the colors has a sad luster in my heart. I'm bored of everything. I'm bored of trying to be okay, I'm bored of trying itself. Misery is a huge bubble that I live in. I'm not accepted for who I am so I have to hide behind a mask every single fucking day, acting pretending to be someone that I'm not. The dark and the light is the same, darkness is reality and the light is the darkness in its illusioned clothes. I'm tired of everything. I've been waiting for love but i never got it. I sleep for 13 hours wake up hoping that someone texted me but no i guess my existence and disappearance is the same. Maybe if I died I'll find the peace that I've been dreaming about for years. I'm hated maybe not literally hated but it will be literal if I took my mask off and showed the people around me my true and real self. I'm not even accepted by my own self. This nose this hair this body this face. The life is going on and the souls are crying. I'm at war with peace it's not coming closer to me. I'm stuck here. There's not escape but death. Music and songs are my drugs but they start to lose their effect on me. I'm tired of everything. Why do we need to study and find a stupid meaningless job when we're all going to die eventually. Oh, god I don't know if you're here or if you're the god that they've been telling us about all the time but if you are why ? Why are you doing this to us ? Life's a sin. Existence is a sin. Our consciousness was a tragic misstep in evaluation. We're not supposed to be here. We're a sin, we're a mistake. We're something unnatural that nature created. Suffering has made a dark hole inside of me that keeps sucking my soul in. Evil and good are fighting and we are the victims. Cigarettes are burning, we like it at first but we get addicted to it later, the same goes for life, every moment we grow up we get attached to it more and more. Maybe that's why I should leave it in the middle of my road, but why ? it's the failure again. Life wouldn't be good ever. Misery is not going to stop ever. That might be a goodbye my friends, I'm going to the spring.#Suicidal_intention
I have been pondering over this question again and again why do we live. We live to make a difference, to make our lives better and to prosper. I have been thinking what I have achieved so far. I have achieved regrets, worthlessness, self-pity and remorse. I had not done a single right thing in my life but I am changing that right now. By ending my life, I am rectifying my 24 years of mistake. I am very happy to do this. This is the best decision ever I could take in my entire life (well, my life was very short!). Ending my life gives me the greatest pleasure ever. Reliving the pain daily hurt so much.#Suicidal_intention
I wrote my first suicide note today. I've been having suicidal thoughts for months now. And yesterday. I broke down and realized whatever was keeping alive. wasnt enough or worth it anymore. I haven't done anything's yet.. but not a day goes by without me thinking about it.#Suicidal_intention
i had never done it before now. i just planned on you know, just. killing myself without a note but it’s strangely calming me down knowing it’s about to be over. letting go i guess. the note is deadass so but- lmao. i cant picture myself waking up tomorrow. i’m not even that sad right now. i’m kind of at peace. just tired.#Suicidal_intention
It’s been a while since the only thing I can think is killing myself. And i almost tried it two years ago. And i guess I have almost reached my expiration date. Things never work out. Even if you tried your best, even if you put your whole health on the line and force it to workout. It just never seem to workout for me. God knows I have tried. I have cried a lot of nights and days just for the smallest of miracle or luck. But, I don’t know what I did so wrong that I am going through this. All I feel is pain. Knowing that I am being a burden to everyone I care about. So, I guess I’ll be counting down on days. And I hope my death will bring peace to the people around me. Rather than causing them all the misery with my presence.#Suicidal_intention
Today was a hard day. I kept finding myself thinking about the way I'd take my own life. After awhile I wrote a lengthy letter to a friend explaining everything and just saying goodbye. I felt a tad better for some reason. Not really sure why I'm posting here, I just still am having those thoughts.#Suicidal_intention
I would have so many apologies to give to all the people I continue to fail and worsen their lives with expectations. My boyfriend, who has so many dreams about us together that I know I cannot provide for mentally. My friends, who tried their best to hammer in nice words about me but my stupid brain won't accept anything good about me. They deserve better than me anyway. My mom, who says I'm her lifeline but I'm so useless and in mental anguish that I cannot live anymore. I don't even know how to go about writing a suicide note, more or less specializing them. I just want to thank them for all the support they've given me, no matter how useless it is. And I want them to know that there's no saving me because my mental state is too far gone, like flesh melting off of me in a house fire. I just need to tell them that I appreciate the undeserved attention and that life truly will be better for everyone without me.#Suicidal_intention
"Last night, you yelled at me for ""writing too much/writing all the time"" that it's all I do and I never want to do anything else. I do that on the side of my regular daily chores/life stuff. But what you don't know is all that writing I do is one long suicide note full of quotes I find online or from music that relate to how I feel. In the end it's going to be a collection of all the shit you and others have put me through. And I will leave them for all of you to read if you wish. That is my suicide note"#Suicidal_intention
Hi! I've entered an irrecoverable state. I allowed too much time to pass me by while failing to perform. This can not reassuringly be stopped in the near future nor can past opportunities be regained or recovered. This will cause me lifelong suffering I can't escape. Since my problem has no solution I intend to self-terminate my life. I'm sorry it has to be this way. I'm sorry for all the potential lives out there that could be hurt by this. I've made so much progress. I've made so many mistakes. Unfortunately I don't find it viable to continue. I held out this far since I didn't understand the cause of my problems. I thought it might have been viable to solve the issues and continue with essentially the same prospects as I had before. This isn't remotely possible anymore. Above all I can't stop the cascade effects on time my absence has left the last 7 years. The pain is too great and the weight of my failures too heavy. A sudden change in direction is unlikely. Thank you to all of you out there who has been part of my life. I'm happy to have lived it.#Suicidal_intention
Hello, everyone. I’m sorry for what I’m about to do. But please let me explain that this is for the best. My name is Sherman, and I am finally putting an end to all of my suffering and my pain. I apologize in advance for the dramatics, but I think for my last words, I’m allowed have as many dramatics as I want. So here goes. I think I was always destined to die young. I feel my existence on this earth was predestined to be cut short. In all honesty, I couldn’t cope with day to day life. My darkness bubbled and toiled to a boiling point, to which I could no longer fight against. And no matter how much I tried to change, I will ultimately die knowing that I am bad person. A selfish waste, someone ugly inside and out, who didn’t deserve the goodness of those around them. Someone mediocre, only capable of making just as mediocre art. Who didn’t deserve the kindness, and the love, someone not strong enough in the end, to overcome the overwhelming self hatred and pain that had been a part of me so long. To my family, I know our relationships were not always perfect, but I will always hold love for you all. I wish you could’ve seen me for the man that I was, instead of the woman I wasn’t. Please take care of each other and remember to show each other kindness, and understanding. To my closest friends, thank you for everything you’ve done for me. I will forever be thankful for the kindness you’ve shown me and I will never forget the memories you’ve given me. I treasure you so much, thank you for making my life more bearable. I’m sorry I couldn’t stay longer. I love you all. To Sonya, you will always be family to me. You will survive this. You are stronger than you realize, and I know you will be okay. Promise me to take care of yourself while I’m gone. You deserve so much and more. Thank you for being by my side as my friend for so long. You’re going to do great things. Thank you for being my roommate. To Bobby, I’m sorry I didn’t get to see you become an official pilot. You were truly my best friend and I’ll never forget the years of support, love, and friendship you have given me. Watch for me in the skies, and live a long happy life, borb. To Joshua, thank you for being someone I could turn to when I felt alone and isolated from those around me. Thank you for being someone I could rely on, who always was honest, who never hesitated to tell me what you thought. I’ll always fondly remember our parties, our laughs, our trips for fast food, and our friendship. To Kaitlyn, I’m sorry I let you down. You don’t deserve to go through this much grief, and I’m sorry to do this to you. You’re a wonderful person, talented, inquisitive, and joyful. Please know that I considered you like a sister, and that I will always watch over you. Do what makes you happy, even if others don’t agree with it. You deserve happiness. To Ramon, I will miss our long night seshes, our deep conversations about relationships, the world, our feelings, our past, and I will always treasure our time together. You were one of the most loyal people I know, and I’m thankful to have met someone so hardworking and strong. You will find someone deserving of you, and you will find your happy ending. And lastly, to my love, my angel, my world, I am truly sorry. I hope you can forgive me. I never wanted to do this to you but I could not bear to drag you down with me. But you deserve better. You’ve always deserved better. I’m sorry I couldn’t be stronger for you. Please know that I will always love you, mi sol, mi luna, mi estrellas, and that I want you to live on without me. To live your life the way you want, with no one to drag you down. You deserve to be happy. I’m sorry that I couldn’t be the one to do that in the end. But you deserve to be happy with someone who can make you happy. Promise me you will live on without me. This is the end I suppose. I was a failed artist, a failed musician, and a failed friend. A failure to the fullest extent. I don’t deserve to be here anymore. I’m sorry for the pain my aftermath will cause. I only ask this. Please release and finish the last of my music and publish my art. It’s what I would want. I know it’s not good, it’s not polished, it’s mediocre at best but god dammit if it can make some people happy with the things I’ve created then then it’s worth it to me. Happiness is always worth it. I’m sorry I wasn’t strong enough to be able to see it come to fruition. But the sun inside me has died, and I have nothing left to live for. I hope one day you can all forgive me for this. I love you all so much. Best regards, Sherman.#Suicidal_intention
Blacked out last night, came home from work and found a suicide note on the floor. Not the first time I’ve ever blacked out, not the first suicide note I’ve ever written. The thing that bothers me the most about this one is I forgot to say goodbye to my mom and my little sister. Can’t imagine how much shittier they’d feel if they saw I didn’t even bother to mention them in my suicide note. I just had to get this off my chest#Suicidal_intention
ive written a really nice suicide note and now i want to do it more. its very pretty sounding, and has quotes and things. im lowkey proud of it. ill probably be gone soon so my parents can read it and finally realize how much pain im in.#Suicidal_intention
Everyday I just want to kill my self. No matter how many people I tell or what they say it doesn’t work. It just makes me want to shut down and not listen. Everyone says the same shit and I can tell they don’t mean it. I get no joy out of anything I do. Those rare moments of happiness I have are quickly followed by an immense sense of dread like I don’t want myself to be happy. I do so many pointless things just to please others. I know no one will accept me for my true self. Whenever I do feel happiness I go right back to feeling empty and annoyed at existing. Everyday I think about shooting myself multiple times a day and it won’t stop no matter who I tell. Worst of all I only feel shame around my parents. They always want me to do something extra when I barely feel like doing anything at all. They always see me so annoyed and distant and they never make an effort to change their behavior. I find it nearly impossible to explain my true feelings to anyone and this just makes me feel more alone. I always feel like my parents look at me with shame and this frustrates me. I do not see the point in extending my suffering any longer. I don’t give a fuck about their feelings because they never gave a fuck about mine. Whenever I did try to tell someone how I felt I just felt stupid for feeling this way. I beat myself up internally constantly so when other people are mean it hurts 100x worse especially those I love. I feel others constantly try to invalidate my feelings rather than truly address them. I’ve even started cutting and no one noticed. I’ve just wanted to end my life for the longest time. I’m sorry#Suicidal_intention
It was on my mind and i wanted to make sure I can leave something behind for friends and family. I have to figure out how I want to leave it for them to find cause I have no printer here. I might just post it on google docs and make it a public document and send it out hours / mins before or something. But I put a lot of thought into it and its pretty lengthy. I am NOT making it to the end of this year, though. Definitely sooner rather than later. Things have been twisting and turning into such shitty ways and I'm steadily losing hope. The only thing pressing me forward is deciding how to make my exit, and getting my affairs in order before I do. I hope they honor my wishes in it but if I have to make a will and get it notarized I'll do that. I have thought about this a lot. And i dont want to reach old age. And i'm sure I am going by my own hand whether it be jumping off something on campus, overdosing, or something else. I'm just sorry I'm so selfish to those that care for me. This is my last post until the day before I commit suicide. Bye for now. Besides I feel useless and like I'm not amounting to much right now. No one calls me anymore. Not a lot of people text me. Sure people contact me through social media and I do appreciate that. But I'm tired of feeling alone and crying all the time. I'm miserable and I want it to end. People will move on. People will forget and thats okay. If you took the time to read this, thank you too.#Suicidal_intention
I’ve had a long history of the crazies. I’ve had my ups and downs, planned suicides, not went through with it for some reason or another. But the other night I spent hours researching suicide methods (I don’t have easy access to my gun anymore, which was my main plan last year, since I’m at college) and I wrote out a note and everything, then fell asleep. The next day was the best I’d felt in months honestly. It was weird. I’d spent the whole night being the most suicidal I’ve been since before I got on antidepressants (got off them at the start of the summer, probably a bad idea but I don’t like being numb) and then the next day I was social, I talked to people, I felt actually okay. It was weird. I went back on a decline after that but it was nice feeling good again. I know it’s not normal to be writing suicide notes and planning my own demise and all that jazz, but is it weird to feel so much better after? Like I don’t know if it was just a needed release or what, because I mean I still want to kill myself, I’m not better. But I’m just curious if anyone else has ever experienced the same sort of feeling.#Suicidal_intention
I have felt like dying on and off for the past 8 years or so. My mental health is the worst it has been these past months, breakup, lost my job, failing at my degree. I'm a burden to everyone I know. The more I wrote out explaining myself, the more it made sense to me to end things. I truly think that some people never get better, and I am one of them. I think suicide can be selfish, but I think me dying will be the kindest thing I can do for those around me. I am distracting myself tonight, but all that does it put this truth in the back of my mind. It will be back#Suicidal_intention
Does anyone else feel this way? I feel better when I read your stories. I don’t feel alone when I hear about other people’s suicidal ideation. So thank you, I guess? There’s a chance that I’ll kill myself in the far future.#Suicidal_intention
"With nobody to ask how I'm doing, or no signs to stay alive, I finally think I'm getting closer/ready to commit. ""Why don't you reach out to family- friends- etc?"" you might ask. I only did that when I was holding onto hope, and I have no more hope anymore so that's why. Nobody can convince me to not go through with it, I just hope this attempt works. I've decided June 1 st, (funnily enough I finally made a solid decision after too many metaphorical straws piling up). And I'm going to notify my friends that are closest to me that they won't see me anymore."#Suicidal_intention
Hello this is the first time in my life that I am planning ahead of time to commit suicide specifically on June 2, 2021, around 11 am by jumping off my computer science university building. Just have to mentally prepare for days to do this. I am more than ready. Wish me luck. Reason for suicide is the university. Will make 1 more post about it on June 1, will also try to livestream the event on reddit a few minutes prior to suicide for anyone who thinks I'm joking. Thank you for everything#Suicidal_intention
I've given up on my hopeless life, my fucked up head abd what i think about, no sane person would want to be with me but I have a boyfriend who would be very hurt if I die and worse, my parents would falsely blame him because that is how they are. I'm really considering it and cutting isn't helping. Suicide seems like a very selfish option for someone who's in a relationship and I've already hurt my boyfriend a lot (P. S he's not the reason I'm committing suicide and the only reason is me and the person I am) It really seems like the only way out. #Suicidal_intention
I felt like I was spinning out of control the past couple of days, so I tried calling the suicide hotline tonight. I told the person on the other line how I was feeling, and after pausing for 5 seconds, she ended the call. Well fuck, if these people are supposed to be the last resort for getting help and they hang up on me, I really must be an awful piece of horse shit. I tried calling again because I started to reach really dangerous levels of distress, and after telling a different woman all that has been going on, she just said she had no words or advice to give me and eventually ended the call. Well, I've reached out to my family, friends, health care workers, hospitals, and even the goddamn suicide hotline and no one seems to give a fuck about what happens to me. Everything is starting to come full circle as I get a clearer sense of what I mean to people. Currently researching the most effective ways to die.#Suicidal_intention
I've had several people bring this up to me when I've opened up to them about my suicidal thoughts and honestly I'm tired of hearing it. I know I've thought about my family's reactions a lot when I've been considering a plan for killing myself, so I'm tired of people thinking that we're all just selfish for being suicidal. Not only did I put heavy consideration into my family's reaction, I also thought they probably just wouldn't care or would be better off without me even if they did care. Depression and suicidal thoughts can literally warp your thinking and make it hard to think rationally about these types of thing.#Suicidal_intention
I don't know where to go or what to do. I feel so alone. I don't have the will to live anymore. I just broke up with my long term girlfriend. We had been dating for over an year and a half now. I'm in love with her, but I know staying with her isn't healthy or good. Her ex was her bestfriend until two months ago. Her ex is really toxic and abusive (mentally, physically and emotionally). The ex, let's call her B, didn't let my girlfriend, A, go. A kept trying to leave B but the suicide threats would ensue, along with physical abuse. I tried to help A get out of that situation but she loves B too much to let her go. A left B due to personal reasons in March. All throughout the entire year and a half, we would have fights due to her ex. That A prioritised B a lot, that we weren't spending any quality time, etc. A was gaslighting me and telling me that it was all in my head, that I was being toxic by asking her to not spend time with B. That I was the one making stuff up, and I was overthinking. Now, two three weeks ago, A confessed that she wasn't really over B when we started dating. And that I wasn't wrong in any of the fights. Since then, I'm daily experiencing panic attacks, and nightmares. I have anxiety issues, which worsened over the course of the relationship. And now, they've gotten much worse. I am going through a major depressive episode. 6 hours ago, I ended it with her. But I don't know how to go on with my life. I keep having suicidal thoughts. She somehow put the entire thing on me again. She told me that it wasn't right to blame my mental health on her. I just don't know what to do. I keep crying and I hate myself for dating her. I would've saved myself so much pain if I just had left earlier or wouldn't have ever gotten into this. I've seen her ex choke her and beat her and abuse her. All of that trauma is still with me and A keeps asking me to move on. I don't know if I'm right or wrong anymore. I get triggered whenever B is mentioned. We've never had proper discussions about how A was emotionally cheating on me for the past one and a half year. We've only had outbursts which end up with me having multiple panic attacks and then passing out due to exhaustion. We were in an LDR for the past one and a half month. I know it's not okay to stay because she was emotionally cheating on me, she hadn't moved on from her ex when she started dating me, she kept gaslighting me and stonewalling whenever I tried to talk to her. I just feel so low. I can't stop crying. I don't want to live. It all hurts so much.#Suicidal_intention
Right now I’ve got loads of paracetamol/pills etc. that’s option 1. I’ve got access to bleach downstairs, I guess option two. Maybe knife/scissors is option 3. I have to do it right now so I can’t wait for a train or anything and I’m at home so can’t do that. Could fill a bathtub and drown maybe? Option 4. I really want to kill myself now so plz which one works best.#Suicidal_intention
I want to die I will kill myself. Im sorry that you had to know me. Dont feel bad. Its not your fault.#Suicidal_intention
I want to die. I am going to try again tonight but I have a feeling it’s going to fail again but I hope it goes well#Suicidal_intention
I am an 16 and i got raped by my older friend 18. The worst thing is that he was able to make me cum. I ahte myslef, i hate myself. He blames it all on me aswell. That i enjoyed and that shouldn't have been gay. I am going to kill myslef tomorrow. I have laready purchased the rope. It is really my own fault.#Suicidal_intention
I was about to kill myself again tonight but I calmed down a bit after talking to my boyfriend on the phone. I’m trying to distract myself with videos and journals but I’m still having such strong urges to end my life. Why the hell am I still here if no one in my family cares. They know my condition but they still treat me the same way which pushes me to think about ending my life. I wish everything would stop, it’s hard to think, it’s hard to breathe. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I wish they cared about me. I’m always always alone and nothing will seem to ever change that. I don’t even know if any of you will care. I wouldn’t be surprised if no one replied. Goodnight.#Suicidal_intention
That's it really. My life isn't half as bad as some of the people's on here, but I just can't stand it any more. I'm so so tired. I feel so guilty for even saying it, but I had to tell someone. I want to kill myself.#Suicidal_intention
I want to die because I'm too ugly. I can't tell anyone about it because they'll just think that I'm vain or seeking attention, but I'm REALLY suffering because of my appearance every single day. The first and last thing I think about every single day is how much I hate my face. It doesn't help either that I'm surrounded by gorgeous people all the time. All I do is cry everyday in my bed feeling like the ugliest person in the world. Therapy and medication didn't do anything so I just want to disappear already.#Suicidal_intention
I want to die. I’m just too weak for this world. I can’t take it anymore. I just want to give up once and for all #Suicidal_intention
Can someone please give me a decent reason why I shouldn't commit suicide? I mean why shouldn't I? Because of my family? Well they are the reason I want to do it! Because of my work? My life? They are all the reason I want to commit suicide? So why not? I mean what is the difference between me and and my neighbors or my friends? Do I do anyone any good? What's my point in this world? And it is one less person in the world taking up resources so it helps with overpopulation. Why shouldn't I should do it?#Suicidal_intention
Im thinking of breaking up w/ my boyfriend so i can commit suicide. We’re about to get married within a couple of weeks, but for a long while now I’ve been wanting to break up with my boyfriend because lately i feel almost certain that i want to commit suicide before I turn about 35.#Suicidal_intention
I will commit suicide today. I have been struggling with life for a while and i cant take it anymore i just wanted to take it off my chest with telling to someone#Suicidal_intention
My life is fine for the most part with some recent hardships, nothing absolutely awful, but I really just dont want to live anymore. It’s not strong enough for me to make concrete plans or act on impulse, but yesterday I decided to start skipping doses so I can make my depression worse and ignore the consequences killing myself would have.#Suicidal_intention
I believe I am meant to commit suicide. No matter how much success No matter how much I improve I will never love life nor myself to the point where I choose to live. I would rather die and never exist than to experience happiness. It's not worth it. Let me be forgotten.#Suicidal_intention
I know it's horrible of me. I feel sad for them but a part of me deep down is jealous. I wish I was dead so so bad. I just cant understand how they managed to succeed, because dying is super hard, attempting suicide can leave you with brain damage, paralysis, damage in other organs, and I just want to know how to succeed already. I wish I was dead already I want it so so bad I just need to know how to get it right#Suicidal_intention
Are there any ways to commit suicide that's not quite as scary nor painfull? I live in a country where you can't have guns so can't use those. Would like to to in a way where I don't traumatize someone like seeing me jump off from a building or like jumping in front of traffic or a train. Was planning on doing it in a public toilet at night and call the authorities right before I do it so that my family or anyone else won't see my dead body. Was originally going to slit my wrists or throat but I don't now how succesfull or how painfull it is tbh. I fucked everything up and I'm really not a good person too so this is what's coming for me.#Suicidal_intention
whats the most painless way to commit suicide?. I have been drinking and I want to commit suicide because I have had enough of life, whats supposed to be the most painless way to commit suicide? I have nothing to live for.#Suicidal_intention
I just want someone to talk to, someone who is open minded. If you always have that knee jerk response to suicide then I'm afraid I don't want to talk, it is really uncomfortable. I just want a person to hear my situation out and judge it, maybe I really have no way out and the only rational way is suicide. I have no clue who to talk to, I just want a rational person who isn't reflexively against suicide.#Suicidal_intention
I am not depressed but I still want to die. What is a good reason to not commit suicide. Throwaway account because I don't want people to find me on this subreddit. First of all, I am would like to clarify that I don't suffer from any mental illness. I am a 17 years old woman and I was thinking about taking my own life the past few months, even though I don't have any reasonable reason to commit suicide, but that's a another story. I don't have any reasonable reason to commit suicide but I am still thinking about it. I literally have the best life with two caring parents and classmates but I am still thinking about it.#Suicidal_intention
Least painful way to commit suicide?.My mental health is so broken past any sort of repair that i’ve contemplated this for the last few weeks. I haven’t been able to stir up the courage though due to the fear of pain that would occur during the process. I’ve already done research and the consensus is that hanging by suspension is probably the easiest. I would appreciate real answers.#Suicidal_intention
I know you can overdose on drugs and that you can get alcohol poisoning and stuff, but can you purposely commit suicide by drinking too much alcohol?#Suicidal_intention
Dont wanna commit suicide but feel i have no other choice. I cant last much longer in this hell im living in#Suicidal_intention
I wanna kill myself but I am too much of a coward. I have at least 4 notes stacked up for the event I actually do it. If I wasn't so scared to take myself out.#Suicidal_intention
I cant take it anymore. I am 35 and struggle every day. My parents abandoned me and robbed me off everything. My childhood was horrible. My stepfather tried to rape me. I was homeless in 19. I went abroad but lost my job because of panic attacks. I have many health problems. I suffer from terrible anxiety too. I want to die. #Suicidal_intention
I wanna commit an elaborate suicide where it'd look like natural causes. I'm already overweight and in a shitty condition, so I think it wouldn't be hard to look something up. I don't want to make anyone feel guilty, especially my parents, who ironically are pretty much just that.#Suicidal_intention
Everything I say here is true to the events that have occurred over the past 3 months, I think about suicide every day. I have been playing a game for several years, over 3 years of logged play time. I had been trying to complete every achievement. And I was stuck on this one difficult achievement. I hired someone to complete it for me. They ended up backstabbing me basically and took over $10k worth of virtual items, money, and time from me. Not only that they left a chair and rope item along with items spelling out the word “fag”, and in the notes interface calling me a loser and telling me to die. That would have been eventually fine to get over except for the fact something else had come up. I had owed another player some money and still had a small portion left to pay, and I informed him I could no longer pay him due to the fact I had just lost everything and that I would work towards repaying him but it would take a bit of time. He went ahead and proceeded to try to get be banned from the community and started with getting me permanently banned from my clan of 1 year. What he said to do that is beyond me, but he proceeded and I immediately went to buy in-game currency so that he would not further damage my reputation. I had spent $140 to repay him at the point. My clan would not let me rejoin, most of the community would not let me back in. The one server in which I helped people in, the owner has turned on me and stated he will permanently ban me for asking to be unbanned, which is extremely ridiculous. I did put out hasty video of details on the original guy taking $10k worth of virtual goods from me, the number being a complete estimate, I can’t bring myself to actually look at my logs to see how much was lost. It’s as if no one understands what I’ve been through, I feel as though i’m unimportant, and that my whole life is meaningless, there is no one to support me. I’ve dug myself into this game world so much that I can’t stay quiet and I can’t focus and can’t move on with it lingering behind me. I’m just teetering back and forth between going through with it. I tried cutting my left arm, it hurt and there’s a scar. I don’t know why I did it, someone irl saw it and now I feel like I’m being judged. Can I not harm myself in peace? I’m just so sick of this and everything but I don’t know if I want to end it. I’m afraid and I don’t know what to do, I feel like I’ve tried everything. I’m unable to talk irl to others I feel, they will mark me as a mental health case and judge me like I already have started to have been judged. I don’t know what to do.#Suicidal_intention
Trying to muster the courage to commit suicide since I always fuck up everything. My depression and anxiety is so bad that I can't even tie a fcking rope. My mental illness has drained me of all energy and I am mentally, physically breaking. I can't take this anymore. I want to finish this. I don't know when or how.#Suicidal_intention
I am so absolutely sick and tired of seeing people share suicide hotlines, and long posts about people who commit suicide. For the first time in my life i have told TWO people i want to end my life, but yet nobody is listening. I’ve been told you get what “you get what you put out into the world” “what do you expect when your constantly focusing on the negative”#Suicidal_intention
I want to commit suicide but I’m too afraid to die. I seriously want to release from this misery but just to afraid of what comes after that, like how would my parents - grandparents would react, where will I go after it all end#Suicidal_intention
I want to commit suicide, but I'm not brave enough to do it.#Suicidal_intention
a few nights ago... i tried to kill myself by strangling myself with an exercize band. i just feel alone and i know for a damn fact nobody will love or care for me again like Lizzy (my ex) did, and I am never going to have that person by MY side to hold me up when i am down, Be there when I need them most, or just to talk to. Thats why I try to do that for others, because I dont want to see anyone going through what I am with nobody to help them back up. The only thing that stopped me was a picture on my dresser of me, My mom and dad, and my grandparents which made me think of them. they are the only ones in my life who are there for me and it is because they are forced to.#Suicidal_intention
I was the best student of my class for 8 years, but now I'm at the very bottom... I'm hopeless, unmotivated and thinking about suicide. I'm at ninth grade, in the middle of the pandemic. No one understands me, not even my parents, they just tell me to study, but I can't study something I didn't learn. There's no teacher, no board, no class, I can't learn shit by reading but no one understands. I wish I never lived. I wanna fucking die, my entire life was a lie, being the best student for 8 years was meaningless, all a big fat fucking lie. After all these years, and now the teachers are telling me that all those years aren't worth shit. This year is important, if I don't get good grades, I'm not going to a good school, can't choose the grade I want. And my life Is gone. Then fuck my life. Your expectations are stupid. I can't learn your bullshit in a custom Telegram you've made for this dog shit country and it's student. I can't even continue. I'm sick and tired, I give up. I'm exhausted. I feel sick knowing that my entire life was pointless.#Suicidal_intention
Today me and my little sister got into an argument and she told me she hopes I commit suicide. I used to selfharm and I still have bad anxiety depression and pstd and do sometimes still have suicidal thoughts. She knows all this and still said that. Now I'm just upset and really hurt that she was say that to me and I just don't know what to do I'm feeling extremely depressed.#Suicidal_intention
Is there a painless way to commit suicide? Anyone know any? I’m not doing this for attention so pls don’t say anything mean. I’m very sensitive. I’m just curious because I feel like I might need that knowledge some day#Suicidal_intention
I want to commit suicide and I don’t want to be talked out of it. I just want to know the best way to leave this evil world for good. Pills? Nooses? Guns? Razor blades? Is that too messy?. I’m not leaving a suicide note because no one gives a shit.#Suicidal_intention
"I mean, i never thought committing suicide would be this hard. Its been 7 years ever since i start thinking about it, but holy feck its actually very hard. Especially when most of the people says ""suicide is for cowards,weaks"" like what? For me, i need to overcome those 2 things; My father,mother and sister's situation after i commit suicide. Things that awaits you behind death. I just cant overcome those 2 things, but i dont want to live either. Idk what to do, basically a stalemate."#Suicidal_intention
I need a way to commit suicide. Please just help me out by doing this , i dont want any other things to be said , just a way to kill myself , i was thinking of cutting my wrist , please help .#Suicidal_intention
"This question is very important to me so please help. First of all, don't try giving me any ""it gets better"" bullshit, I'm not waiting any longer for life to magically improve. I've tried all I can to have a better life. At this point all I want is a death that will do some kind of good. What places will accept my body if I die by suicide? I would appreciate any attempts to answer this question very much. Edit: if I'm unable to donate my body anywhere, can I perhaps just have it disposed of by the hospital or write somewhere that I explicitly don't want it to go to my family? I really don't want my body to go to the people that abused me"#Suicidal_intention
Painless way to commit suicide without drugs or guns#Suicidal_intention
How do I gather the courage to commit suicide? I started thinking about it over ten years ago, bit my stupid, selfish, cowardly mind won’t let me. My parents fight like cats and dogs, the only reason they stayed together is for my sake. My mom is super controlling. I pretty much have no friends. No one likes me. I fail classes left and right. I’m way past the age of moving out but I still live with my parents and I’ve never had a relationship. It’s very clear no one wants anything to do with me. Plus I already had cancer. My life is literally going downhill year after year. I wish I could be brave enough to do it one day and put myself and everyone out of their misery.#Suicidal_intention
i want to commit suicide very soon, i just don’t know how. i’m done with the constant thoughts they’re just crippling, i can’t ever get a break. i’m trapped in a body i hate, in a home i hate, with parents i hate and everything is just impossible to resolve. i can’t see myself alive in a year i just want it all to end now. my girlfriend has to make me feel guilty about suicide to stop me from killing myself everyday, i don’t have any reason to live anymore i’m just tired. i was able to talk with my therapist a few weeks ago but for some reason i stopped having appointments and i don’t want to ask my parents why because i’m too anxious, it felt like i finally had some hope and then it was all taken away. there’s nothing left for me in life anymore, i just want to rest now.#Suicidal_intention
I’m pretty sure I’m going to commit suicide tonight. I can’t participate in this life anymore. Everything has been thrown at me since birth, from family problems to just chance events, and it fucking sucks. I just can’t see the my life getting any better, and I’d rather take control now before it inevitably gets worse. I don’t really know for sure what happens to us when we die, but it has to be a hell of a lot better than this. Even if it’s just decomposing and being eaten by worms. I’m just ready to be done with it all.#Suicidal_intention
It may not be today, tomorrow, or even 10 years from now, but I honestly think there's a 90% chance that the way I will end up dying is by killing myself. I've struggled with depression since I was 14. I've been making significant progress in therapy and I am the happiest I've ever been. But somehow I keep ensing up depressed and coming back to these thoughts. I have a fear of being elderly and alone. I am divorced, don't have kids, and don't have many friends. I'm afraid of living in an old folks home and just being forgotten about. And then today I realized that I pretty much already am forgotten about. I moved across the country a couple years ago, none of my family or friends ever call me. My mom never calls, my sister doesn't call. The only time my best friwnd messages me is to complain about her life. She never asks me how I'm doing or what's going on with me. I'm always the one calling them, and if I don't we simply don't talk. It's like my fear of being alone has come true, the only difference is I'm younger and able to take care of myself still. I do have an amazing boyfriend, but lately I keep screwing shit up so I wouldn't doubt it if he left me soon too. So ya. It may not be today or tomorrow, it might even be 10 or 20 years from now. But unless I have an accident of some sort this will probably be how I die. Edit: Wow I can't believe how many people have the same thoughts and feel the same way. I'll try to reply when I can. It's comforting to know we're in this together. Thanks for the encouragement everyone. It actually brightened my day a little. And please please don't hurt urselves. One thing that has made a huge difference so far for me is EMDR therapy. I've tried all kinds and that one has helped the most#Suicidal_intention
Last night I tried (and failed) to commit suicide via overdose. I was taken to hospital after my partner was concerned about me and called the police and ambulance. I was unconcious all night, but woke up this morning.#Suicidal_intention
I am too sad to even commit suicide. Does anyone relate to this? I am tired of the endless suffering and pain. Life is completely empty and lonely.#Suicidal_intention
everynight i think about killing myself and basically cry myself to sleep. I mainly want to kill myself because my parents fight all the time, My dads always gone but when he's home all he does is act like an asshole, im 17 but foor soome reason my bones ache, back hurts, and weak asf for some shitty reason, havent seen friends in awhile, im completely home every single day, going insane, i just dont see the point in living, completely failing school, i probably sound like a cringy fucking retard typing this.#Suicidal_intention
This is just gonna be a lot of rambling, and English is not my first language, sorry if I'm not making much sense. I might just jump under a train. That might actually be the surest way to kill myself. I don't wanna live anymore, I'm so embarrassed that I've become such a fucking loser. My gf dumped me almost a year ago, and I still think about her constantly. She was over me from the moment she dumped me, she's living her life, fucking around, doesn't care about me anymore. I'm starting to realize how lonely I am. I thought I had some friends, but I actually don't. I always have to ask them to do something. They never ask me. Sometimes they ignore me. When I tell them about the things I struggle with, they don't seem to care or understand. Can't call them friends tbh. Same goes for my family. They tolerate me, but the contact I have with them is superficial. Most of them would only notice I'm dead after a few months or so. I'm bad at my job and I'm in constant stress because of it. They only person I can think of who'd care that I'm dead, is my mother. I know she loves me, although she never really shows it. But I'm not gonna keep living for my mum, that's just pathetic. If you happen to know of a painless and sure way to die, feel free to share it.#Suicidal_intention
Preparation for my loved ones before I commit suicide. Im planning to take my own life tomorrow. Any advice for all the tasks before leaving? E.g. password for accounts,suicide note, etc#Suicidal_intention
Please help I’m so close to wanting to commit suicide. I can’t think of one good reason to stay#Suicidal_intention
Is there even a way to commit suicide without risking brain damage?. That is like the only thing that deters me from hanging myself or ODing. I fucking hate this. Life is so shitty than even giving up on it is difficult.#Suicidal_intention
Personally, I think around 75 - 85. I've been suicidal for many years but somehow, I'm still here. I have some unsuccessful attempts but from the time perspective I think it was more like a cry-for-help... However, due to long-term depression, I think that eventually my life will end with suicide, I don't know when or where, but I don't see myself as an older person and I think suicide will come quicker than serious illness or a fatal accident.#Suicidal_intention
i’m gonna commit suicide on saturday night my parents refuse to get me treatment, and every day feels like a blur. they told me not to be selfish when i told them i needed to go to the hospital immediately. they took all the ropes, but i’m not gonna use ropes this time. i have a better idea and they don’t know i have it. my mother doesn’t want me to live at my father’s house when she’s the main problem. she said she was sick of me and that she wanted to “give up”. i cant eat, i cant enjoy anything anymore. my mother tells me to fake it, but then my life would be one big lie. the funniest thing is, she told me not to fake it in front of her or my father. but if money is more important than my life to my parents, i see how it is. i’ve explained several times that i can’t live like this anymore, but they don’t listen.#Suicidal_intention
I am going to commit suicide very soon. I am struggling with depression, borderline personality disorder, anxiety, hypersensitivity, loneliness, and obsessive thoughts of suicide. The psychological pain is so unbearable. I don't want to live a life full of pain and misery. I think committing suicide is the right decision to make in my case. After all, what's the point of suffering ? I forgot to mention that I tried working very hard on my mental health in the past, but each attempt was made to improve myself has failed miserably. After that, I just lost all the hope and accepted the fact that I was born this way and there's nothing I can do about it. I have already bought the necessary tools for committing suicide and I am only one step away to my death. Why would someone in my case want to continue living ?#Suicidal_intention
Tried to commit suicide the other day. On Saturday I attempted to commit suicide by swallowing a bunch of oxycodone. The minute I did it I felt this huge regret. Like I didn’t want to go through this at all. I ran and told me husband. I took nafran and we went to the hospital where I ended up throwing everything up in the ER bathroom. I immediately felt shamed and guilt and selfish. To avoid going to the psychiatric hospital I told the hospital I only took five on accident since after throwing up I felt perfectly fine. I now know I don’t want to die. I want to live and be with my family. But there’s still bad thoughts that pass through my mind. I just recently upped my Effexor to 225mg ( on Thursday) so it hasn’t had time to work I think. My kids know nothing about what happened but I know I put my husband in one of the worst spots of his life. How do I fix myself for him? TL:DR Tried to kill myself, now feel awful and want to make It up to my husband#Suicidal_intention
Anyone else want to commit suicide but afraid cause it's painful? I'm so depressed and I really hate my shitty life but the only thing is stopping me from killing myself is the pain that i would have from killing myself#Suicidal_intention
"I wish I was allowed to commit suicide. I hate how suicide is so stigmatized by society, and how much guilt-tripping there is surrounding the issue. I am not ""mentally ill"" for being suicidal, rather my wish is a product of rational choice. I no longer believe that life is worth living and I am not interested in living it. Everything in the whole world dies in the end, and I would rather that end be sooner so as to avoid putting up with all the hardship in between. I can hardly bring myself to be interested in anything anymore, so to me the world is at best boring and at worst painful. I have little interest in ""improving"" either myself or the world, as both things turn to dust in the final analysis, along with any accomplishments I or anyone else might make. I just want this whole pointless existence to be over already, as I see literally no point in it continuing. I am aware that this might hurt people around me, but honestly their entire existence, let alone any pain they might feel, is as fleeting and pointless as my own. I just wish it was socially acceptable to see that suicide can be a rational decision and to act accordingly. Maybe then people would not feel so trapped in a worthless life, and would be able to commit suicide in a relatively safe and painless manner rather than using their own makeshift methods."#Suicidal_intention
It really makes sense for me to commit suicide. No future no hope no nothing. It truly makes sense to me that i should do it i just can't figure out how. It doesn't make sense going through this for nothing i just can't find one reason. It makes sense if i do this inhave nothing to live for why just continue to suffer i have literally no reason to be living right now#Suicidal_intention
I want to commit suicide because my teeth are in terrible shape. Hi everyone, I'm a 22 year old girl here who has really bad teeth. They used to be really good years ago until I was confined to my house for school (Got suspended and eventually expelled for wanting a better social life, long story), which cased my depression. (I wasn't allowed to go out and have fun either). When I started staying home, I started to eat a lot of sugar as a way to cope and didn't brush my teeth after (gross I know) and at the age of 16, I ended up with a ton of cavities on my teeth. Six years later, I start to notice stains and multiple cavities (maybe even secondary cavities). I have a huge fear of going to the dentist because the last one I went to had a nasty lady who shamed me for my teeth when she drilled the cavities out. I'm very afraid of getting an infection and I don't know what to do. I can't go because I have high risk parents and I'm still under the care of my aging dad. I don't have access to my money and no car. I'm in literal tears every day because of my teeth and I regret eating so much sugar. I want to kill myself to be honest. I'm so embarrassed about them. Every time I look at my twin sisters teeth I weep.#Suicidal_intention
i feel morally obligated to commit suicide. When i was 16, i did a terrible thing and ruined someone's life. i have been ignoring it since then but lately it has been impossible. one thing i have known since the moment it happened: if i was ever confronted about it, i would have no choice but to end my life. i've had a couple suicide attempts before, mainly because of depression. in those moments, i knew part of my problems weren't actually there, and that my brain malfunctioning and bad habits were doing all the work. things you can fix, things that will go away. this will never go away. i will never be able to undo the pain i caused.#Suicidal_intention
Thinking of going to a hotel to commit suicide. I’m saving up all the extra money I get I’m 18 and keeping it for a couple of weeks. I’m planning on renting a hotel an hour away from my loved ones, go to therapy so I can discreetly say goodbye to my therapist and thank her for everything without her catching on, and go kill myself in my hotel room so my parents won’t have to find me. I’m going to do it in the bathroom and leave a note on my bed so staff will not walk in and see my body without warning and be traumatized. I want to make this as easy as I can for everyone. I’m ready to go. As soon as I get the money I’m gone. Bye, thank you all for everything#Suicidal_intention
Best way to commit suicide. Im just a burden to this world, For my family, Friends (when i still had friends) and everyone else in the world. Im a fucking ugly piece of shit who doesnt deserve love.

I just dont want to live anymore i have no friends, a family who hates me, im an ugly piece of shit who will never get a girl. This is my last hope soon i will end it.#Suicidal_intention
whats better way to commit suicide? Take a lot of pills and jump into a deep water body. Take a lot of pills and hang myself with a rope. Still not decided what pills to use but it will take 2 hours of browsing to figure that out.#Suicidal_intention
"I'll commit suicide when my parents die. This is just an off my chest kinda post. I had a good childhood, i have loving parents, i have great, caring friends; even though u ghost all of them. I literally have no reason to be suicidal, yet I am. My parents wont be able to take it if i go now, theyre close to their 50s. I just hope they live a good life, while seeing me. Thats my only goal now. As soon as they die, ill commit suicide. This is the only reason Im living right now, so that my parents dont have to suffer anymore. They poured so much into me, time, money, love. I cant just let that all crush them. Ill try to give back as much as i can and then Ill go. Thanks for reading so far."#Suicidal_intention
How to commit suicide without feeling pain ?. Is there any method?#Suicidal_intention
What kind of pills do people use to commit suicide? Is there any medications to take that are physically painless suicides?#Suicidal_intention
"Like I'm 200 done. Ready to commit suicide. Every cell in my body is desperate to go and screaming at me to kill myself. But I live with my parents and younger sibling. I dont have a rope. Sure I could just start drinking everything poisonous that I can find in my bathroom but what if it doesnt even kill me, I'm scared of just being left in pain and damaging my organs and still having to live. If I had a rope, I know I'm desperate to try, but apparently your body starts thrashing around to try to get oxygen, so my family would definitely hear me and find me, and then surely I'd end up brain damaged beyond repair? I can overdose, but I'm almost certain it's not going to work and I'd be dragged to the hospital and everyone would know. That's the worst part, is what if my family find me, which they will because we live together, and then they take me to hospital and I survive and I just have to live with them knowing for the rest of my life?? That's the horrifying, awkward part. They would be so mad and I would feel so exposed and vulnerable at them knowing. My friends would walk on eggshells around me and judge me. People I dont even talk to would reach out being all fake like ""here if you need anything"" and then dissapear again the next day. That's what I dont want - the attention. If I'm going to do this, I want to be gone. I dont want to face the humiliation of everyone knowing my darkest struggles and reacting weirdly. I want to be gone and not see their reactions. But theres no guaranteed way to die, I mean I could try a train or cliff but we are in lockdown. I barely leave my house anyway so my family would be very suspicious. But even if jump off a cliff i could survive and be paralysed. Like what would happen then. I'm just like not even able to get help from anyone so I'm just lying there, is that how it works? That's pretty scary. Guns are banned here by the way. The method I'm looking at the most is to hang myself, maybe overdosing could work as long as nobody is around to come and find me, I could try these things and maybe they would work. I need to be like in a woods or something. I could just try to up and leave but it's so out of character, my parents would try to find out where I'm going and that. So I guess I cant really do it but I'm serious when I say I really have no reason to be here anymore. I literally hate being alive with every cell in my body. "#Suicidal_intention
Am I the only one who wants to commit suicide but is too scared of going to hell. I’m a huge fucking disappointment to my parents and I feel like nobody in this goddamn world loves me. It’s me against everyone. Every day something goes wrong and I don’t want to continue living. Humans are dicks and the world is filled with more asshole than good people. My dad actually came in my room as I was writing this message and I got in trouble again. I just want peace. I hate this world.#Suicidal_intention
i failed my test, even though i tried the hardest i still failed with a F1 now i just want to commit suicide. I JUST WANT TO END IT ALL. I CANNOT HANDLE THIS SHIT ANYMORE!#Suicidal_intention
"Just ordered the tools to finally end it. At this point, it's not an ""if"", but rather a ""when"" I commit suicide. Like the title says, I just placed an order to get the tools for my preferred method. I'm dysphoric af, depressed af, and just a total failure. At least I've got a cover story for why I need this item when it shows up at my house (I live with my parents), and then I've just got to wait until they're out of the house so I can be done with this pitiful world. I can't wait to embark on this beautiful journey into the vast nothingness."#Suicidal_intention
how do i commit suicide. Im trying to figure out how to kill myself. i don't want any accidents so i need a method that's easy and definite. it'll be so embarassing if i wake up in the hospital after a suicide attempt. please give me ideas. thank you#Suicidal_intention
Why is it so hard to actually commit suicide, even if you’ve been depressed and romanticizing the idea for a really long time?. I’ve been having a lot of extreme highs and extreme lows. When I get in these lows, I can’t move. I physically am in so much pain that I can’t move. I’ve always have a dull “back of my mind” depression even when I’m in a high. Whenever I think about killing myself I think it’s be too painful, or it makes me guilty thinking about my family. But I’m so alone. I mean, my dad likes my brother more and constantly takes everything out on me. My boyfriend is stuck in a relationship with me. He says he’s happy and loves me, but I know his mental health is plummeting, he could’ve had a much better gf/life, he’s had to put up with my depression and dissociation from life, my eating disorders, etc. And my brother doesn’t have that same connection to the real world. He’s always had a bit of a delay and trouble expressing emotions. When I was in the hospital for 2 weeks, he posted on instagram a picture of me with a post that said “pray for my sister because she’s in the hospital for abusing pills” or something like that. I overdosed on OTC meds like benadryl and ibuprofen. Definitely nothing hard. I genuinely think I’d be better off out of this world snd that it won’t ever really get better. But I just don’t get why I can’t bring myself to it.#Suicidal_intention
I got hit by a train and now I don't know if I could physically stand up to go commit suicide. My arm is broken, I'm missing one of my front teeth, I have stitches in my face, my leg is broken from the knee down, it could take over a year to learn how to walk again, my parents found out I smoked weed and sold explicit pictures and videos of myself. My face got fucked up in the accident. I have no way to reach out to friends or trusted adults. I've had problems with suicide and self harm in the past before I turned 18, but now it just seems much more hopeless, there is nowhere for me to go, I feel isolated and stuck here. I feel like the entire accident is my fault, my friend got hit too, with a much worse outcome than me. I honestly would not mind this being the last thing I type, I with I had died on my first suicide attempt so things wouldn't have gotten so out of control. I think I was supposed to die young, because it seems like things have only gone downhill. I have multiple therapists I could talk to but my parents won't leave me alone with them on an online meeting, this is the only way i think I can reach out without them being involved, I've been racking my brain for ways to end my life but every way I can think of requires me to stand up and walk, I think I could do it, but using my walker is loud, uncoordinated and attracts too much attention from my parents that are also in the house. I don't know what to do anymore, this is one of the only ways I can think of to reach out.#Suicidal_intention
Can you commit suicide with a pencil? . I don’t have enough guts to use a knife or do it at all, but can you?#Suicidal_intention
I want to commit suicide as a means of escaping adulthood. There are a lot of new responsibilites and expectations that come with being an adult, none of which I think I can handle. I’m a pathetic mess of a person who barely manages to acomplish the most basic of tasks, there’s not a chance in hell I could live independently, keep up a job and manage my money properly in order to pay expenses and just general living costs. If anything the fact that i’m 20 and still living at my dad’s place only solidifies that point. I should be responsible for myself at this age but i’m not. So maybe I should just die instead to avoid further embarrassment.#Suicidal_intention
My only reason not to commit suicide. I am a 23 may girl, have been thinking and actually obsessed with the idea of committing suicide these months. And I realized that everytime I think of how people would react upon my death, my mom's reaction always stops me. I remember that summer of 2010, when my grandpa passed away. Her cry kind of haunted me for quite a long time, and imagining making her cry like that once more is rather more unbearable for me than my state of being right now.#Suicidal_intention
I know suicid will not end it all. I want to commit suicide but I know it's not going to end.I am muslim and Islam says if I kill myself I won't be able to go to heaven.#Suicidal_intention
how to suicid proprely ? how do i mutilate my self proprely please like how do i cut where what object to use #Suicidal_intention
I want to commit suicide but I am upset about my family and relatives who actually cares. Is there a way to tell your family that suicide is a way I will feel better? I dont need help. I dont want my family getting upset because of this. I just want to them let me go. I will eventually be free of this daily torture#Suicidal_intention
I wanna commit suicide. I just can't handle it anymore, its too much for me. i wanna die know. i just want to let go of everything. i'm sorry for anyone who has liked me, anyone who has believed in me. I just want a pill that i can take that turns me dead. i don't want to exist anymore. i am a burden to everyone and everything is a burden to me. i just want to let go now.#Suicidal_intention
I want to die so bad but i’m so stupid and afraid of pain. I failed my overdose attempt so i’ve been thinking about hanging myself except i don’t have a proper rope and i don’t know where to find one. I don’t even know where to tie it for it to work#Suicidal_intention
There’s always this feeling of impending doom. I have no idea how I’m still not dead yet but I don’t see myself having a future other than suicide. I don’t see myself being successful and employed one day with family and kids. Life’s so meaningless and I think I’m just waiting for the right time to end this one day.#Suicidal_intention
"So basically the issue is my wife says she doesn't love me anymore, and is trapped with me, but occasionally (Every couple weeks) initiates sex. But she won't ever let me touch her outside of that, or cuddle, or do anything else intimate, up to and including really having any conversations about anything, serious or non serious. Like, I am obviously trapped because if I left I wouldn't be able to find anyone new in a pandemic, and if we got divorced the court would give her all of my income and leave me homeless(Per several subreddits on here) (Edit: Those subreddits appear to be pretty misogyny filled now that I’m looking through them so I don’t really trust their take on things) so no one would want to date me anyway because I would just be a broke, lonely fuck in my 30's. So basically I am trapped and unhappy, because I don't want to leave the relationship if I can't find someone new (And spare me the ""You only need yourself"" crap, that sounds a lot like someone trying to politely tell me I will be alone forever if I leave, and is NOT what I need right now, and part of why I want to die). I don't even want to interact with my son anymore because I am so upset with what's going on, it's like I have totally withdrawn into myself. So basically I can't stand being with someone who doesn't love me, but I also can't stand being alone, Suicide seems like a logical answer in this case, and I am not depressed and do not have any other sort of mental illness so I would probably be allowed to just kill myself and no one would intervene, correct? I mean, if I thought I could find someone new, I would leave, but I don't, so basically I am trapped between two forms of absolute misery, and death seems to be the logical choice."#Suicidal_intention
"I want to commit suicide. Hello. I only have reddit for this specific purpose so please no ""life is precious"" or ""it gets better"" speeches. I need someone to give me step by step instructions on how to kill myself. I'm in the Philippines and Idk where I could buy cyanide pills. I heard it's the most painless. "#Suicidal_intention
I want to end my life, im ready to go. What's the best and most painless way to do it?#Suicidal_intention
Does anyone else want to commit suicide out of spite?. That’s not my reason now but back then when the world decided to flip me off and give me the shit end of the stick I wanted to out of spite. To let those kids who bullied me to know how badly they fucked up. The teachers who sat there silently knowing what was happening at the time. My parents who did all but jackshit when I begged to move schools. I was just curious though if others had thought the same?#Suicidal_intention
"Pretty much what the titel says. I know deep in my heart that i am going to commit suicide, but i believe i should be stronge a push through even if i dont feel like it.I am on the verge, so i wanted to hear what kinda things you guys do to avoid killing yourself. I have little time left, maybe i get better and its gonna be a long time left. I respect very much that you guys might say ""it gets better"" or ""this feeling is temporary"" and if you feel like that is the best advice to give i will not stop you. I believe you guys wants the best for the people around you and i do truly hope the best happen to you guys to."#Suicidal_intention
Hey guys. Im heavily contemplating suicide. I’m thinking either cutting or hanging myself. Do any of you know the best way to do this? My only problem at the moment is finding a place to do this. I dont want my parents finding my body like that.#Suicidal_intention
How do I build the courage to commit suicide?. I was wondering if there was some method one can use to build up the courage to commit suicide. I have googled this question, but most of the responses were just people trying to discourage the suicidal person from killing themselves, so I was unable to find any practical advice.#Suicidal_intention
"Good evening, I just wrote a long story here but deleted it all. Why would anyone read so much about a random person like me. And for some reason I feel like I dont want to be judged about my decisions in life. I guess the only thing the story led to is: If my family, friends and now even my wife never treat me with any respect. If they never care and just use me for their own good. Is it really so wrong to commit suicide and leave them behind. Right now I dont have contact with family, I dont have any friends. I am alone with my wife who mentally abuses me and today even physically abused me. I dont have any good reason or any sad story about my reasons. After a long day of thinking I figured out that my reason is revenge. Honestly I just want to take revenge on people for leaving me alone. And I know this makes me a bad person. And I assume you will all think I am a bad person. The only thing that scares me now is that its so permanent. Suicide has been a relief in all my live. All the difficult times I though ""at least I can always commit suicide to get out of this easy"". But now after my first failed attempt I know this time I wont fail again if I do it. I wont make the same mistake and survive."#Suicidal_intention
I get no joy out of this shit anymore. I am in constant pain. None, NONE, of the help I've been offered has helped me in any way, shape or form. I'm 15 (16 in two months) and transgender (was gay before I figured out I wanted to live as a woman). My classmates are homophobic as shit, the waiting times to receive any kind of gender affirming healthcare in this country are so long. I have to wait for up to 4 years to receive any medication that'd help me, and even if it wasn't, I won't get it anyway. The dysphoria clinics here can cancel the investigation at any time and for any reason - they've told me time and time again that I won't get on hormones if I'm this depressed. I want to be forgotten forever, I want no funeral to be held. I want to perish and to never be thought of again. I wish nothing but to die. Killing myself would be so liberating. Not having to deal with this awful place would be so so amazing. I've a plan, and I will carry it out. I've heard survivors speak of instant regret, but I don't care. I know I'll still have suicidal thoughts if I still survive. I just want to get this over with. I've no reason to stay. Take care.#Suicidal_intention
I want to kill myself so bad, but at the same time I don’t. A better way of putting it is that I just want to cease to exist. I’ll probably never have the guts to actually off myself. I’m 16 and I know life might get better but the reality is that it probably won’t. Every day is a struggle. Just getting out of bed requires maximum effort, and it scares me that I might live the rest of my life this way. This feeling is terrible. Because I know if I kill myself, the pain will probably stop. But if I don’t, and I know I probably won’t, the pain just keeps on worsening until it’s almost unbearable. I’ve attempted before, but I’m too scared to do it again. The thought of living my life this way until the day I die terrifies me. I’m just done with it all, and I wish I had the courage to go through with it.#Suicidal_intention
This feels different than other days. I woke up with the strongest intention of committing today. As soon as I opened my eyes I felt it. It feels like I won’t be able to make it through today without constantly thinking of the different ways I could commit. I’ve accepted that. I’ve already cut this morning, trying to mitigate this desire but it feels almost overwhelming. I cannot stop thinking about how peaceful death will be as I know none of this will get better. These feelings are only at bay when I’m sleeping and even at that they still infiltrate my dreams at times. I can’t escape. But at the same time, I have an escape.#Suicidal_intention
"idk why am i writing this but anyways. Recently i finally tried to kill myself. it wasn't a ""big thing"" just took a few pills, but the intention was there and finally wasn't just thoughts. well, i had bad stomachache and throw up everything, my parents discovered, but they didn't do a thing, well, they did, they passed the entire evening condemning me to hell. i told my closest friends who know about my life situation but the most they said were ""don't do it, don't think about it, it's not worth it"". Okay, i know it's difficult to help someone in this situation, but i really need some support, because it was my friends presence that kept me going all these years. i didn't know what i expected telling them what i did, but i just need more actions than kind words  and yes, i go to therapy and i felt the same when i told my therapist about it felt like it was nothing. idk, sorry if it seems selfish or that i did it because i need attention but my point is, im aware of my situation and im doing everything i can to get better but i don't know if i can keep doing this alone, especially now that the situation with my family got worst and worst (i live in a very toxic and abusive household) i wish i could have someone to give me a hug and take me out of here and tell me things are going to get better "#Suicidal_intention
I am going to commit suicide on 25 01 2021 (my 18th birthday). Pretty much the only thing worth living for in my life was my girlfriend. She is my best friend and the only person who has had any faith in me. We got into a huge fight a couple of days ago. I said some hurtful things I didn't fully mean and I feel like I may have damaged the relationship irreversibly. We almost broke up. While we are still together, things haven't been the same and I fear they will never be. I would rather die and have her remember me fondly than live and let her see what a piece of shit I am. Just wanted to get this off my chest.#Suicidal_intention
My simple reason to commit suicide. My life is a failure. Or rather, it has been stolen from me. I became dysfunctional after all the abuse and lost too much. There are seven billion people on this planet. I'm just one of them. My life is nothing special, and I don't enjoy living it. That's it.#Suicidal_intention
I always new I would commit suicide. I’m nothing. I’m worthless. Everyone would be happier if I were gone. I tried so hard. Got so many degrees. For what? I’m a shit wife. Shit mom. Shit person. I wish I were brave enough to pull the trigger. I was hospitalized a few weeks ago for a failed suicide attempt. Wish I would have succeeded#Suicidal_intention
"I'm 14 and I want to commit suicide painlessly. I'm already sure that I'll be the one who'll kill myself so please spare me the sob story. People are such hypocrites to tell me that ""you matter"" and spread positivity and shit like that. I just am so sick of it here. I'm planning to end it all after Christmas. I want to die not suffer more. I'm sick of people acting like they like me, for all I care they think I'm crazy. I seek help and still feel like over-reacting. And maybe I am crazy. I crave attention and love from people. Thats why I still wanna survive without getting brain damage and shit. This whole paragraphy is making no sense but who else can I talk to but people who feel the same way as I do? I've tried to do it several times but somehow my plans never suceed. I see no purpose in life so why am I even here? Just to suffer more? Dead or alive people wouldn't care so might as well get done with it. The younger I am the less people I'll meet"#Suicidal_intention
I am neither sad nor depressed, but kinda bit scared about my close future which is about my career path and my first-step towards the social life (things like interviews, works or volunteers usually). I really don't know where to go in my life and if someone asks me what is your plan or vision, I had to say I am still considering. I also recently realized that I am not even qualifying the mediocre in my study area, or way worse than I thought. I feel like I live my life with wrong optism and escapism, and this led me to a serious suicidal thoughts. What have I done, or moreover, have I even achieved anything worthy over this 19 years? None. Does anyone here ever had suicidal thoughts because of uncertainity of your life in terms of job or studying? If so, how did you overcome it eventually?#Suicidal_intention
It's like hell. Never-ending torture. Feeling trapped. Before my rant, I just wanna apologize for any vulgar language. I feel so fucking sad. Its just feels like no one understands. When I say i want to commit suicide, people simply laugh and then dare me to do it. Bitch, what do you think. You don't fucking know the amount of times I've stayed up until 3 in the morning, with narcotics in my hand, ready to swallow them all. You don't about the night where I cut my leg up. Because you don't give two shits. Because as long as you live your happy, merry fucking life, you don't care. You wouldn't even care after I died. My own mother laughed when I said I didn't want to live. She mocked me, she asked whether she should go out buy a gun or bring some pills. Her level of neglect is fucking crazy. She'll randomly insult me, slap me, beat me, and fucking starve me. My dad isn't any better. He said that if I died, that I should die outside of the house so that I don't fucking curse the house with bad luck. He swung a baseball bat at my face and pinned me down the other day. When I was younger, he would always slap my ass and although I'm older now and voiced my being uncomfortable, he still continues to do it. Friends don't care or help either. I don't even know if they're friends. They never initiate conversations. Theres no one that will call me and ask how I am. Out of the 7 fucking billion people in this world, not even one would ask how my day was. Because like I said, people don't give a shit. And when people just ignore my existence, they fucking hurt and backstab me. Even without all these issues, I fucking hate myself. All I do is sit in my home and do nothing but fucking play video games. I don't do my homeowrk and I sit there wasting my time. I just have so much potential that is wasted. I do so well on tests, but I don't care abotu school at all. It just so fucking frustrating to see people who don't share the same level of knowledge and passion for learning, but even thats a fucking excuse. The people around me are all finding meaning in their lives and becoming successful. They're going to boarding school and winning competitions, whereas Im barely getting As at a public school and getting fat, due to my lazy fucking fatass. Im a lazy piece of shit that deserves to die. I just feel so pathetic. Why do I even exist? Just to suffer one more day. It seems that theres no end. It feels like running a marathon where the finishing line is constantly pushed back#Suicidal_intention
I've been depressed for years and last year it started getting worse when Corona started affecting everything. I lost dear friends, a normal life, started isolating myself and realized who my real friends are. I lost contact to almost all of my friends besides my few dearest friends and I'm really thankful for them. My mother doesn't understand why I'm depressed but accepts it. She just doesn't react to things in the right way and encourages my depression and selfharm. My brother thinks I'm faking it and my dad doesn't know anything. I really appreciate my boyfriend and my few closest friends for helping me and for being there for me but I feel like a burden. I just don't want to annoy them with my problems all the time. And I don't want to kill myself yet, I love all of the people I listed and my dog as well as my bunny. But I feel like I'm loosing myself, I feel like a corpse, I feel dead. So might as well just kill the body that's left here. I don't want to feel empty anymore, I want the emptiness and pain to stop.#Suicidal_intention
I haven’t been on here for awhile. Been actually “trying” to make things better. But, everything keeps falling apart. I’m pretty sure I have advanced periodontal disease and erosion. Which is crazy, because 4 months ago I had perfect teeth. Now, I have new spaces in my teeth and they aren’t white anymore. I went without insurance for awhile due to being laid off from covid. So, I didn’t have the means to go to a dentist. I think I’m going blind. I have floaters in my eyes. Again, this didn’t start until Covid. I think I have alopecia and basic hair thinning. Again, didn’t start until covid. I use to be gorgeous and now I feel like a monster. Now, my use to be perfect skin isn’t perfect anymore. It took me years to get clear skin. And, now I’m breaking out again. All on top of trying to get my life together after covid. I don’t talk to anyone. I’m too ashamed. So, I’m always alone. And, getting all these things fixed take money that I don’t have. But, I noticed. Everything goes bad now. It must be a sign that I’m meant to not be here. I just wish I could get the courage to just do it. But, I feel like my sole purpose is to take my own life. And, I’m okay with that. I’m just afraid to do it. I don’t like pain. And, I know there isn’t a painless way to die.#Suicidal_intention
I’ve been visualizing hanging myself in my room since yesterday. It’s my birthday in two days. I can’t stand one more ounce of disappointment and pain. My latest therapist in a long string of them didn’t work out and I have no options left. I tried in April and when I look back on my life I don’t see an ounce of happiness - no friends, relationships or pets - none of the most basic sources of joy. I’ve been cut off from everything with no hope of it changing. My head hurts right now and I haven’t been able to sleep properly for days. I had a therapy appointment that made it all worse. I don’t know what else to type because my face is blank and broken and my brain is failing me. I need to put this body to rest I don’t know what else to do. There is too much pain to live anymore and without an end in sight I’m broken#Suicidal_intention
"Hello, i wanted since a long time to end my life but one thing stopped me everytime; pain. I will not get trough the whole reason but i will resume it, this is just one reason but also the main one ,i have a dream and nobody take it seriously or respect it, my parents says only negatives things about it and does the opposite of encouraging. So now that it is out of the way i will ask it, how do i commit suicide without pain and without spending alot of money ? "#Suicidal_intention
I’m going to fucking kill myself. There’s no point and I finally expressed my feelings and the other person yelled at me told me I was making them anxious and told me how terrible I was.

"Every night I go for a walk to the bridge in my hometown, I light up a cigarette and sit on the fence. I look down at the road and always think to myself that I would want to jump. I don't know why but then my thoughts change to: ""What if tomorrow would be better?"" And I wait another day. And nothing changes. I should just jump next time."#Suicidal_intention
I can’t stop crying. It hurts so bad. I’m so miserable and I can’t handle the pain anymore, I want to die so bad. I want to hurt myself so bad. I’m hyperventilating and having a severe mental breakdown and anxiety attack. I want help but I think I’m beyond it. I just wish I was dead. I wish I could stop breathing. I want a gun so bad. I wish I wasn’t such a disgusting worthless piece of scum shit. I wish I wasn’t so insignificant. I’m praying I’ll die.#Suicidal_intention
Recently, I've been fantasizing about committing suicide in a public place, whether it be on a bus or in a grocery store. The primary reason for this is a sense of loneliness and the need to be acknowledged by others. Is this a common thing for depressed people to think about?#Suicidal_intention
I am too disgusting for this world. Don't even think of trying to help me. You will end up being hurt. I ruin everything I touch. I hurt people,ruined their day,possibly even left them with trauma because of my shitty behaviour. I have no talent,no passion,and I never did anything special. Other kids near my age or even much younger than me did great deeds,became famous,even saved lives,and yet I'm not special. BUT I HAVE THE SOLUTION FOR THAT! I WILL JUMP OFF A BUILDING AND BREAK MY BONES AND SPILL MY INSIDES EVERYWHERE! HA! YOU THOUGHT I WASN'T GOING TO PUNISH MYSELF?! The useless spoiled brat will be gone. She will be a rotting corpse with maggots on it. She will dissapear. I hope you are happy now. Goodbye world.#Suicidal_intention
I just graduated and i also think i have a failing relationship with someone who i love very dearly because of their very controlling mother. I Dont really wanna grow up and i never been afraid of death. I frequently had suicide thoughts for years but never acted on them but its not looking like a bad option#Suicidal_intention
I’m a 25 year old male and have nothing going for me in life. Literally nothing to look forward to besides getting drunk every weekend. I’m in the military so I’m far away from my parents. I’m always alone. I’ve tried getting into hobbies. I go to the gym frequently but even that feels like a drag now and I go right back to feeling like a piece of shit after I’m done working out. I also Bought a motorcycle recently which was always something I wanted to do. I enjoy the hell out of it as I’m riding it clears my mind completely however when I get back home and it wears off I’m right back to feeling like this. I can’t even find a girl who wants something serious with me. I wasted the last 7 months of my life recently with a FWB that I ended up catching feelings for just for her to tell me she’s not ready for a relationship when I asked her to be more than FWB. Nothing seems to go my way ever. Life is a fucking drag and I don’t see happiness coming my way in the future so what’s the point of being here? I wish I had the balls to end all this bullshit tonight.#Suicidal_intention
 I think the scariest part right now is I know I’m not going to make it far. My life right now is like a ticking clock. I have a plan to leave on June 21st. I’ve had this plan for a couple weeks now and this is the first time I’m sticking with one for a while. My brain is going full auto-pilot mode on everything it’s like I have no control. Today I got the 900mg pills I’m going to swallow, and immediately my brain is starting to think of suicide notes and what to write to who. I literally have no control over it I’m trying to lay in bed so the thoughts are gone but all I think about is the 21st. Nothing else matters. I want to ask for help but my brain won’t let me.#Suicidal_intention
On June the Tenth, I will kill myself and end this sad miserable life.#Suicidal_intention
Im just tired of life. This world is so beautiful but the people on it are so terrible. Im an infp and everyday i wake up and see the terrible things we as humans have done and continue to do, it makes me depressed and knowing we are all going to die one day doesnt help. My parents are always yelling at me, calling me overdramatic and saying they cant wait untill i see the real world, i spend 10-11 hours a day,6 days a week, sitting in front of them doing homework as they berate me because ive been failing my classes this year. They call me lazy but i just dont see the point. Why should i have to spend my whole life doing things that dont make me happy? People say its my life, and yet it doesn't feel like it. I cant even be sad without being made to feel like im a terrible, selfish person for doing so. Money spent on items and trips doesnt make up for the emptiness in my soul, i long for pure love and kindness but i dont think it exists here anymore. I just want a small cabin, where i can wake up and make art because i feel like it, sing and dance because i want to, bake and read books and just enjoy my life but in todays modern world I can't do that it seems. There's so many things i want to talk about but i cant ever seem to say enough to describe the.unberable feeling of not belonging, that i have. Ive always had a feeling im gooing to die young, even as a kid. And it's only getting stronger everyday. If im going to die anyway why cant i just speed up the process? I feel like im not here im just passing through, but either way it has become so clear to me that i cant survive down here. I dont know why I'm here, i didn't ask for this. #Suicidal_intention
No one cares. No one loves me or accepts me. I took sleeping pills in hopes to sleep 18+ hours. It’d be better if I didn’t wake up at all#Suicidal_intention
I always make everything go badly, and honestly, I feel tired, it doesn't make sense for me to stay, since all that will end up happening if I do stay is some poor soul getting hurt again, just because of my damned fears, some people have also made my life hell, and I'm sick of it To anyone who has participated in making my life suck ass, go suck my non existent nuts. I'm out of here, peace!#Suicidal_intention
I don’t want to fight anymore. I’m just so tired. You won depression. I want to die, I want to die.#Suicidal_intention
I am struggling hard and I just don’t know what to do anymore. I came out to my family as non-binary and just like that I lost my whole family. I am in pain everyday emotionally from everything going on. I am trying to work full time right now and literally am trying to figure why the hell I am. I don’t want to be here anymore. I don’t. And I am fucking tired of being told I do. Every night I stare at my meds and just want to shove them all down my throat. Fuck all this pain.#Suicidal_intention
I graduate high school tomorrow and I'm the most suicidal I've ever been. I was taken advantage of on my prom night. No one that was there will talk to me and no one cares. I have college and a future but why keep going if time and time again depression continues to come back no matter what happy events are happening. Spent my 18th birthday alone because no one cares. I want to kill myself. At this point, I feel like that will inevitably happen sometime in my future.#Suicidal_intention
Took like 18 hydroxxyzine pills and 3 xanax drank some wine im ready i just want it to be over, I want to die.#Suicidal_intention
I want to suicide but one thing that is holding me back is the fact that my parents who I love so, so, so much would suffer, and I don't want that to happen. That would ruin their life, but this way my life is ruined and there is not even one thing good about my life. I don't know what to do. I am suffering and I'm in deep depression and can't take no more. I hate this planet and their evil human civilisation.#Suicidal_intention
I actually have no point to live for and I always think about suicide.I tried to fix my life but it came to a point that I can't actually fix it.I just want to and it all but if I do it,my parents and my sister couldn't get over it.My brother died at the age of 12.It's been 13 years but we still didn't get over it so I think if I suicide it would tear them apart.I don't know to do#Suicidal_intention
I delayed suicide bc I didn’t want to hurt my friends’ feeling, but recently I alienated all my friends and I finally could die with no guilt. My death will make people happier and the world a better place.#Suicidal_intention
Can someone please recommend me any suicide methods that can be at least 70% success rate? I've set my mind on it. I'm most likely gonna do it but honestly don't want to suffer any mental/physical aftermath if I fail.#Suicidal_intention
I am stuck. My mother is in coma and will die soon. Both her and my depts are stacking one after another. I have been unemployed for a while. The only close relative I have left is a mentally disabled uncle. After weighting all options, I have decided to killed myself. One of my far relatives died of Ultracet overdose so I took 10 pills and also drank beer. I failed. I didn't feel anything but a bit tired than usual. Is there actually a surefire way to die that is simple to do? Would jumping from tall building does it? I have heard of cases where people still alive after jumping off tall buildings.#Suicidal_intention
"just told my mom i wanted to suicide, she said she didn't care because the only one screwed is the dead one, not her. this relieves me in some way; guilt is no longer an obstacle. im 18y/o and i promised myself that i would kill myself if i was no longer happy in life. just looking for effective painless way to go."#Suicidal_intention
Ive had enough of this life. i dont see the point of going through this shit. i need to set a date, find a location and to decide how to do it. idk if this is the right place to ask this, but can anyone help me plan my suicide? pls dont try to convince me not to do it.#Suicidal_intention
I fucking hate myself and that’s never gonna change one day soon ima kill myself#Suicidal_intention
I've been suicidal since high-school, but lately it's been different. I don't feel sad, or anything. It's just seems like the right thing to do. I'm not emotional about it, I just honestly think killing myself would be the best choice, given who I am and how I feel. Im alone, nonone understands me. No one even tried. No one will ever fappbin love with me, or be my best friend. Even my own parents dont bother to respect me. I have zero control over my life, so why not just end it. It doesn't make me sad anymore. It's just a fact. Suicide is just a fact. I think I'm going to kill myself. Maybe I'll give it more thought, but how much thought could there be?#Suicidal_intention
Maybe next week, hopefully as soon as I think of a good plan. I finally found an actual helpful article on how to kill myself without the author begging me not to do it or putting hotlines there instead of actually answering my question (took me forever to find the damn thing.) I’m tired of seeing other people happy, I’m not even happy for my friends anymore at this point. I love my friends but seeing them graduate, be in romantic relationships, get good jobs, and succeed in life while I’m rotting away barely able to get out of bed hurts me. I can’t stand it anymore, fuck all else I’m leaving. I’m committing suicide later this month.#Suicidal_intention
"I don't even know what to say. I feel so sorry for my parents. They deserve better. I don't know when i'm going to do it but i'm sure it will be by the end of next week, maybe even sooner. Maybe even tonight. I don't know. I have an outfit planned, a beatles abby road t shirt, a pair of jeans and some black boots. I'm going to leave my front door unlocked, otherwise the noise of me closing it will wake up my parents. There's a bridge near my house, i'll listen to some music on the way. The last thing i want to tell my parents is that i love them, the letter that i'll leave will explain the rest. But i really want ""i love you"" to be the last thing they hear from me. Once i'm on the bridge i think i will hesitate, i know myself. I'll probably be very scared, but i also know that at some point i'll just do it. I'll put my eardbuds in, i think i'm going to put on a beatles songs, i don't know which one, and i'll just fall back first into the water. The height is enought to kill me but if not, i'll probably drown because the current is really strong. So that's it i guess, i don't care what they do to my body, the least expensive thing is alright for me. I don't want a funeral with people, i just want my parents there and no one else. I don't want to be on the news or on the newspaper and i don't want my school to talk about me. I want to disappear from the face of the earth."#Suicidal_intention
"i've been thinking about it for over a year now and i still haven't done it because it seems like too much of a hassle. there's no ""easy"" way to do it, especially without a chance of survival. why, fuck. please make suicide easier"#Suicidal_intention
All I want to do is die, that’s the only thing I want. People just keep telling me “wait it gets better” or “just hold on” I don’t want to anymore, I want to let go and I don’t want to come back.#Suicidal_intention
Why is it that everyday is see people I know and their lives are going great. They have soulmates, jobs, money, families, houses, going great in university and even some are getting married. I know live on the outside I different so the inside but I have FUCK ALL. I have no love, hope I’m failing school, no job and a horrible relationship with my family. I can’t have happiness or hope fuck everything. It seems like everything for me is getting worse, my acne is coming back, I’ve been eating unhealthily, my whole body is in pain, I can’t study for university and I was just diagnosed with major depressive disorder and I’ve been drinking a lot recently because it temporarily takes the pain away and I’ve been having more and more panic attacks I just want people to send me some kindness but the world is against me. I’ve been thinking about posting my address so people all over the world can send me letters and gifts of love and support ( let me know if I should). I don’t see a reason to stay, my family will be sad but it will pass. I’ve heard that suicide just passes the pain but I don’t care. I won’t regret it, I just want to die and finally be at peace and it WILL happen soon#Suicidal_intention
I will decide to commit suicide today. Maybe this post will be my last, I don't know. I can't think about anything, I can't focus, I can't listen to people, I make extreme decisions and then give up on those decisions and go back to the beginning, sometimes I feel like my brain is being sucked in, I still don't know what I'm doing right, days go by before I even know what's going on, I always postpone what I have to do, I fail at the things I'm best at, I have little to no people around, so I can't get angry with myself and come to a conclusion, my family still has expectations from me, but I seem to be wasting their years of effort because of what I didn't do, my plans for the future are falling apart. I don't even know I want it, my body's back and neck area hurts every day and I'm tired every night I sleep and I start the day forgetting what I said, I live again. Like I'm a worthless little scarab that can't break this chain. As time passes by my hands, I get jealous when I see people walking around happily every minute. Why can't I be happy? Why why? I don't even have a friend I can talk to about these situations. It's just me and the rooms in my apartment. And today I failed the most important test of my life. I have no hope for my education life. I feel like a burden to my family. I feel like I'm dead. What if I really die? That's one less person from the census. Now I'm gonna make a decision about ending this fuckin' life. Most likely night time. Thank you for reading. I sincerely hope that your life will be filled with beautiful memories.#Suicidal_intention
My life if doomed i’m emotionally numb constantly suicidal depressed been friendless for 4 years i’m a social outcast and I’m too anxious to leave the house I’ve got gender dysphoria I’ve never had a partner i have Asperger syndrome (and probably some other stuff) I can barely spell (text to speech) I’m mean i hate myself and I give off bad vibes. i’m ready to die#Suicidal_intention
I'm so stressed out from school i just can't live anymore. I'm been abuses, and I've tried to kill myself before. If I'm alive tomorrow it will be a miracle. I have a plan and i don't care about the mess. I don't care who finds me or how they find me. All i know is that tomorrow morning they will find a dead body. There is nothing you guys can do or say. I am going to hang myself in 30 minutes. If anyone is going to report it, look at the news channels for Delaware Ohio. If the cops come, i will find a way to make them shoot me. Goodbye, and goodnight.#Suicidal_intention
I have to not kill myself to live to be 18 this November or my asshole estranged dad will try to pull some shit like try to get half my belongings from my moms house or something. Or not have me displayed in my coffin in the female clothes I want or have my tombstone not say the name I want on it. I don’t know if I can make it that long i just want to take all of my seroquel now and sleep and not wake up. There’s no life for me#Suicidal_intention
I’ve done it for months with long depression breaks in between. Its The only thing I’m good at maybe when I get older I’ll transition(honestly) and be a house wife But I know I never well I only have the motivation to clean knowing that once everything‘s perfect I’ll kill myself. There is no future or life for me. I know I’m only 17 but I got a lot of different problems and not just normal depressed teenager stuff and I don’t want to try to fix or deal with it anymore I want to die#Suicidal_intention
I found my dad’s gun and I put it on the dining room table, looked at it and cried for an hour. I don’t see a reason to continue and as each day goes by I feel more and more hopeless. A few days ago as I left class to go home and a very cute girl stop me and asked for directions to a classroom I helped her and found her class and I could tell she smiled at me through her mask, as she smiled, waved and thanked me I got extremely sad that was the only stranger encounter I’ve had this year and if only she knew how much it meant to me. I can’t be happy or even get out of bed. I’m wasting everyone’s time. I just want to die and stop this pain#Suicidal_intention
I lost everything i have lied made up things and my headaches are too much to bear. My uncle died my dog died there is nothing left music won't bring me back either. Tell that i wont be back tell everyone that i have a great way to escape and not feel the pian. Hang myself and then rest there. Hell i can jump off the city bridge if i want to. Bye it was a good time yall but as i set on the bus to my final destination i hope that i will see god and that i can still do everything that i want. It is always better to go out on top right? RIGHT#Suicidal_intention
The antidepressants I’m taking take away my manic suicidal thoughts but they’re still there. Just in the back of my mind. I know I need to kill myself I never functioned in this world. I’m a failure of a person#Suicidal_intention
I recently wrote a list of what I want for my last meal and it just dawned on me that it’s happening and I’m not scared. I know what I’m doing is the right thing for me, I got the pills I’m going to use at locked it away until the day. I’ll try to make the most of my remaining time will I survive, I don’t know I know the method I’m taking is going to cause extreme pain and possible liver failure but I don’t care . Society calls depression the black dog and this dog killed my sunshine all I see it darkness. I had the ideas to post my address on Reddit so my family can receive letters and gifts from everyone. I’m all alone no hope no ambition no future. I can feel the reaper’s hand on my shoulder and I know my clock is ticking and I’ve made peace with it#Suicidal_intention
I am just so done with my life. I don't have anyone to tell how I feel. My crush rejected me. My friends have two faces. My family is narcissistic. Hope I die somehow. After my fourtheen I didn't expirance and happy moments. It's just pain and misery. When I look at myself I look like misery. Wish I had a little sign to keep fighting. I know life is curel but I feel like it beat the shit out of me.#Suicidal_intention
I’m genuinely sick of myself and the kind of person I am. I’m non-functioning depressed all the time and anxious and avoidint. I can’t do anything anymore. I’m sick of putting my mom and sister through me and doing my work for me. i’ve got a lot of mental problems and I’ve taken 6-7 different pills for my depression but none of it works. The best way to describe how I feel and how I feel about myself is “Bad Vibes” my days consist of waking up at whatever time then immediately thinking about what a terrible person I am and then I lay around in my room in the dark staring at my iPad/YouTube to try to forget. I wish I was like a normal person I don’t care to try anymore I want to d!e Does anybody know a painless way commit commit su! cide that won’t damage the brain before death (I believe that the afterlife is the brains activity after death)#Suicidal_intention
I hate my personality I hate my voice I hate how I talk I hate my anxiety I hate Aspergers I hate my avoidance I hate my education I hate How I have no friends I hate my gender I hate my acne I hate the way I look I hate everything about myself. One of the few things I don’t hate is my severe nonfunctioning depression because I know soon it will help me kill myself. I already got “help” and its not working#Suicidal_intention
"I cant stop thinking about killing myself..lately ive been thinking a lot about this,hanging myself mostly,and im afraid a day will come when i will reallt do it..and sometimes when im on the edge of a building,or when im driving,i get those dark thoughts in my head like ""jump"" or ""speed up and jump off a bridge""or some things like that,im really fucking tired of this shit.."#Suicidal_intention
I just want to go to bed and never wake up again. I just want to die#Suicidal_intention
I want to kill myself. I am so over being in pain. I am so over someone who gives no fucks about me having so much power over me. If it wasn't for the fact my dad took his own life years back and I saw the repercussions, I would have done it by now. I don't know how to not be like this. I don't remember it being this hard before. I just want to die and it even pisses me off and makes me more sad that I won't allow myself to do it.#Suicidal_intention
I was just screamed at and talked down to by someone I care deeply for that I don't deserve anything from them, I don't mean anything to them and then I saw a lot I didn't ever want to see. I'm a piece of shit and deserve nothing. I don't even deserve to live. I truly hate it here. I hate this. I will see my plan through in November 2021 as promised. I'm on airplane mode. I just can't anymore.#Suicidal_intention
I just want to die. I don’t deserve life. I have a loving mum and sister, I have friends but I just don’t deserve them. I want to end it but I don’t want to hurt my family. My heart is shattered. I have tied a noose so many fucking times, but I haven’t gone through with it. I feel like when I eventually lose my mum and sister I will just end it all. I feel so selfish. My mum says those who commit suicide are selfish cowards. So I guess I’m a selfish coward. I would love to just disappear and never come back.#Suicidal_intention
The thought of suicide becomes more and more enticing everyday. The thought of sending a bullet through my skull calls me. i have vivid thoughts of it that draw me in. it’s quick, painless, and easy. the best way for me to exit this shit hole of life. it’s not worth it anymore#Suicidal_intention
At first, i thought it was just random that I've thought about being dead, wanting to die and so on. But as a I'm ageing, my thoughts are expending and there is no escaping it. Now i do feel like killing myself. I have the propensity to actually do it. But not to escape love, or someone, but to escape negativesand life. I'm exhausted of crying alone in a middle of the night just contemplating whether i should kill myself or not. I am so done with the current life I'm living. I cannot deny about what others are commenting about me because yes, i was once in that life. I regret everything that I've done and did. But i cannot change what's already happened in the past. I tried being a different person, i really fucking tried. Sometimes i just wanna feel alone, be alone. Living my own life alone. Pls just end my life god#Suicidal_intention
My friends hardly talk to me, and when they do I get blamed and talked down to. My family refuses to listen to my issues, and my sister acts like I’m worthless. I get called selfish or rude by asking for very small things, I even feel like venting here is too much to ask for. I have plans to move out with no contact with my family when I turn sixteen, but I don’t think I’ll be alive at that point. My life is going downhill at a rate I can’t control. My grades are so low I have no chance of passing and the only reason I haven’t killed myself yet is because I can’t bear hurting the people around me no matter how much they’ve hurt me, even though I feel like they wouldn’t care.#Suicidal_intention
So I've been cutting drinking and smoking nothing is helping I've gone through so mutch its unreal it feels like my life couldn't get any worse im only 14 and I have 16 attempts I don't know anymore im such a failure I can't even kill myself idk maybe if sombody would stop using me and actually be my friend it would help a little but it's ok like always i planned on shooting myself in the morning this may be my final goodbye thanks for listening and reading#Suicidal_intention
I don’t care anymore I should just kill myself. I’m mean selfish and horrible my life is already a mess and theres no digging myself out of the hole. I know I’ll do it someday. Please don’t tell me I’m not a bad person or that you care about me you don’t know who I am I could be a serial killer or some thing it’s just a bunch of rhetoric trying to get me not to kill myself. All you’re doing is patting yourself on the back saying “ oh I really care what great person I am” I fucking hate myself if it didn’t hurt my little Adam’s apple so much I would of hang myself by now. i’m a trash person#Suicidal_intention
It's been 1 year 1 full year of this pandemic I can't stand this shit anymore it's way easier to just die than try any more like why the fuck was I put here on this earth I got my phone taken away and I'm using my school iPad for school (and Reddit ofc) I can't contact any of my friends or my bf I lay there at night thinking fuck it it's just so much easier to cut my wrist than to try next week I have to go to court and I don't want to I can't keep living with this pain this aching pain in my heart anymore I’ve officially sunk down to the bottom I don’t want to live anymore it’s to much I smile all the time and my parents and friends think that I’m alright but they don’t know that I’m faking it but fuck it like I said it’s just easier to just die no ones gonna relise I’m gone anyway#Suicidal_intention
Why shouldn’t I kill myself tonight But seriously why? nothing makes me happy anymore even The few things I haven’t lost that I used to enjoy doing are a chore. I have no life or friends or partner I wouldn’t even know how to act around others. I’m not going to college because I’m not smart enough I can barely spell (i’m writing this with text to speak) but even if I was I’d probably be too anxious to even go. I get anxious and freaked out trying to get a haircut I can’t really talk to people. There’s also things with my family that I can’t control like the death of my grandma and my grandpa who’s slowly drink himself to death. he was my father figure because my dad is a POS and my grandpa taught me everything I know and seeing him how he is now is just sad. Seems like doing anything but sleeping or staring at my iPad just makes me worse i’ve been almost comatose for the last six months haven’t been doing anything not even school my mom and sister do it for me because I’m embarrassing terrible person. And the icing on the cake is that my doctor thinks I have Asperger’s (I know there’s nothing wrong with it but it still hurts) The only thing that’s stopped to me so far is family I don’t wanna make my mom my sister or uncle or anyone else sad I know I’m not living for myself my life was over along time ago I’m just dead on my feet. So why shouldn’t i? I know people care for me that means nothing when I don’t care for myself and I have everything I need to do it tonight, A razor pen, earbuds and a showered/tub (my favorite place to be) and its a beautiful rainy night. I know my life is going to end in suicide sometime or another so it would be better to get it out of the way before I’m even more of a disappointment. I don’t have a Will but who cares no need for earthly wants when I’m dead.#Suicidal_intention
I don’t feel like I could do it right now and I’m a little bit scared to but I feel like I need to do it just to get life over with. I have a dark future ahead of me and right now I live for buying things like t shirts And weird shit to fill in the deep hole of depression that will never leave me just for a day or 2. I just don’t wanna let down my mom and sister they care about me and I don’t know why. Suicide is scary looking and messy i don’t want anyone to see#Suicidal_intention
I’m miserable all the time but I can’t make myself do it. I’m just too scared I’ve already given up on this life And I’m only living for my mom and sisterBut I just wish I could kill myself. I just can’t keep living because “things might get better” yeah well things will probably won’t and they may get worse#Suicidal_intention
I don’t have a firearm, but I am certain I need to do it, I can’t see any of this anymore, how many and what types of medicines should I take? Or where should I cut on the wrists or the neck or wherever, that it makes sure it’ll do the job, I’m sure many of you have tried.#Suicidal_intention
You know how when you’ve played a video game for too long you just start to fuck around doing dumb stuff and not progressing the story or game because you’re bored and you end shutting off your game to do something else? That’s how I feel about life. I don’t really care about progressing my life, I don’t care if I die. My dad taught me to always have my bicycle helmet on when I would ride anywhere, but lately I don’t care about that. I take on my noise canceling headphones on, turn up the volume and deliberately takes chances in traffic and crossing red lights. When I am not doing that I think about jumping off a bridge, which I have almost tried a couple of times. The saddest thing is that I have to write on a fricking subreddit for anyone to notice me. Other people in my life take me for granted and I am tired of being taken for granted. I wanna be free and I wanna have friends that care enough about me to not just react when it’ll be to late. But suicide takes a lit of courage and decisiveness that I am still building up. But it won’t take long before I am all ready.#Suicidal_intention
I'm actually 100 serious when I say this. the only thing that is keeping me from slitting my wrist is that is super painful. Because I've tried before and I didn't cut deep enough or something but it still hurt like shit. so the actual thing would be way more painful and that is the only thing holding me back#Suicidal_intention
im going to commit suicide. im sorry to my girlfriend and my family. babe, i love you so much. please forgive me for fucking up again, making you go through all that shit. thank you for loving me. bye#Suicidal_intention
I'm probably going to commit suicide on my birthday, march 7. Things have been sucky for three years and haven't gotten better#Suicidal_intention
I’ve been talking about how I feel in here forever and nothings getting better it’s just worse. I appreciate everybody responding and asking if I need to talk, you all are great. I just don’t know if I’ll ever get better I know i’ll commit suicide soon#Suicidal_intention
I've made my peace with the fact that I'm going to kill myself... One day. My head is a train wreck, my life skills are nonexistent, I have zero reliable friends, I'm disconnected from my family, I'm basically alone 24/7 with my toxic thoughts... But despite all of that there's a degree of comfort in knowing that I can grab a knife or tie a noose at any given moment. For some people going out on our own terms is the best we can hope for. A small victory to end a life of constant losses. I'll take it.#Suicidal_intention
I can't think of any reason to stay. I have no sense of stability in any area of life and I'm fucking terrified. Narcissistic parents that didn't want me. No friends. I've experienced how wonderful life can be, just for marvelling at existence itself and appreciating its divinity - appreciating my senses etc. It's not enough though. My basic human needs aren't being met and I've tried everything. I can't seem to play the character that I need to in order to move through the world. I'm tired. Nothing's getting better, it's getting worse and I'm not a teenager anymore - I'm a woman in my late twenties. I want out. I'm done being alone and being in these terrifying situations. I'm ready to die.#Suicidal_intention
Hi, it's my first post here, I'm new in this community. So I've been struggling with suicidal thoughts for at least 8 years now. Today is my 25th birthday. Things have been extremely bad lately. I lost my job that I adored and I feel useless because of unemployment, I live in a country where unemployment rates are extremely high and my field of work doesn't have many opportunities. Even outside of it, it's hard to find work. I feel hopeless and it has made my suicidal thoughts much worse. I actually plan to do it tonight. I had a shitty birthday and I really don't need to live a day more. Leading up to today, I've broken up with my girlfriend and pushed my family members away from me as much as possible, so it will lessen their pain. It hurts a lot, but it's for their own good. I've tried therapy and medication, it helped briefly but my psychiatrist told me that my depression will keep coming back easily, I have family history of depression and suicide so it's no wonder. I can't keep going through this and bringing down my loved ones. I can't keep living like this. I guess the reason I made this post is to vent. I don't know if I'm actually going to go through it tonight. I hope I'll be able to. My feelings have gone numb and I just want to close my eyes forever. I called a suicide hotline and the operator tried to guilt me into staying alive by telling me all about how my family will miss me. I know they will, but it will pass with time. I'm very worried about them, but I can't keep living for them. It's been the only reason I've kept living all these years... I can't do this anymore. So, tonight might be the end. Sorry for venting. I'm keeping it a secret, obviously, but I felt like I had to tell someone, even anonymously on reddit. Goodbye.#Suicidal_intention
What the fuck is even the point when no one gives a shit about me? Their life makes no difference if I'm here or not. I want the pain to stop so badly I just want to die.#Suicidal_intention
Everything has been a mess. I cannot keep doing this anymore. Even after 3 years of self-healing, and therapy, I cannot find peace in anything I do. Everything is tainted with bullshit. I just wanna kill myself. But I cannot find the courage to. I just need the courage to. If someone here could give me that push, that way to gather up the courage, I will forever be grateful to them.#Suicidal_intention
Like many of you, I am single, live alone, I have almost no social life. Social isolation is contributing to the rapid deterioration of my mental health.  I have little to no support system, and I am struggling with sobriety. I can hold it together while sober, but if I end up drinking, I will kill myself.  I still care about other people so I will therefore not ignore the rules of social distancing. . I also understand that it is unrealistic to ask the immunocompromised to suffer on my behalf so I can get out the house.  Regardless, my isolation-induced suicide is an acceptable public health outcome. which I understand. My life is not worth so much. I'm terminally depressed Wasteoid so why should society care? Society would be much worse of if my immunocompromised parents died than if I died anyway.  I do sometimes wonder how many suicides it will take for quarantine to have not been worth it... For another day of not doing so#Suicidal_intention
I can't. Please. Why does God keep doing this to me. Why does it always have to end this way. I tried my hardest in this relationship and now I'm gonna be in the same place I was last year. Maybe I'm not meant to live. I think that's how I'm supposed to go. I thought I was getting better with therapy but it's all unraveling. Please. I need a way out. I can't keep doing this. I don't want to keep doing this. It's too exhausting to live. Please. Just let me rest.#Suicidal_intention
Single for years because I can't manage relationships. Lonely. Been depressed my whole adult life. Have bipolar and tend to fuck up my life in the brief periods of mania - scars, risky sex, and now a broken heel. Non stop health problems. Endometriosis, a gut parasite leading to severe abdominal bloating non stop for the past 5 months, PCOS, acne. Have been unable to work and am just a place where money goes to die. 100% financially reliant on my dad, who uses that to control me. The only acceptable job for me in his eyes is as a lawyer. Been chipping away at the degree for 5 years and am still only halfway through. There is no hope for me. My body is fighting against me. In some ways it is permanently broken. I don't want children or a partner, and yet without these I can't see the point of life. I have no career aspirations because I hate everything. I am in constant existential or physical pain. I can't do it anymore. My life has not been like most of my peers' lives, and I can't connect with them because of it. I want to sink back into the earth, and float around as insouciant dust. That sounds like the only peace for me.#Suicidal_intention
Hi, I'm looking for advice or encouragement to kill my self. I'm really depressed and having a real bad time living since 2010. I want to hang my self, my plan is to go far into a forest and just do it. My plan is setup but I need the courage just to go and do it. What do you think? Do I need alcohol to fuel the suicide will? Should I just go for it in the middle of the night when I have anxiety and panic attacks? Or should I just be Spontaneous? Too much planing is dumb I know, I will do it somehow anyway.#Suicidal_intention
I took 12g of ketipinor 20min ago.  All i want say is sorry to everyone but i couldnt continue live like this.  Also im sorry to my therapist who called last week. I purposefully didnt tell you the truth. Nothing you could have done.#Suicidal_intention
This is my 5th or 6th bout of extreme depression, and every new one is harder than the one before. Last time, I tried to kill myself a few times and nothing worked, but I've gotten better at doing the drug calculations and I'm pretty sure they'll work if I try again. The only reason I can't right now, is because I have a dog and a cat who depend on me, and another dog who belongs to a friend, who I'm fostering (the dog, not the friend). These are the things which are making me miserable - 1. I hate myself. I have no self worth and I cannot see myself as worth loving or being around.  2. There is a guy I like. We kinda were together for a while, but we were long distance and then we broke. We occasionally text now and even though he acts the way he should (by this, I mean, pretty indifferent), I care more than I should. And that sucks. He's the only guy I've ever thought was good for me and even though I'm fully aware of his flaws, he was good for me, and it sucks that he doesn't really care. 3. I'm a grad student. I'm in the middle of my PhD. Even though I do love my work most of the time, sometimes, it hits me that I'm not doing what I always wanted to do. And maybe I never will. And even this, I feel very mediocre. And for someone who has always been am over achiever, this kind of just jogging along without proper progress is excruciating. 4. I've always wanted to do certain other things with my life even though doing a PhD was my primary goal. I wanted to write. I wanted to do something with music. I wanted to try spoken word poetry, I wanted to do other things and somehow none of those things are working out. It's a lack of opportunity, but it's also a severe lack of motivation as of right now. It's a vicious cycle. 5. My health has become crap. I keep trying to get better, but it's hard and a lack of motivation does not help. 6. I'm financially not doing well. That's not an issue, but my stipend will end before my PhD does, and that fear of the future is terrifying to me. 7. I've lost faith in God. It's like losing a limb. It sucks. 8. I cannot seem to find anyone who I like and who likes me and wants to be with me. I speak of both friends and relationships. I'm literally alone. 9. I'm of no significance to anyone. If I died tomorrow, nobody would even notice. And that's a stupid reason to want to die, but honestly, it makes it harder to want to live. I'm fully aware that it's depression talking. I'm fully aware that this will pass some day and I'm fully aware that my problems are not that bad. But I haven't stopped crying for the last two days and I'm not even sure I can get through any more. I'm terrified I'll end up doing something to myself and that my animals will have no place to go. But that's the only thing I care about.#Suicidal_intention
can't take it anymore. nobody will miss me but i wrote a note. just about my entire life when 911 finds my body. im done with this world, can't take it anymore#Suicidal_intention
fuck me i was in middle of this shit out then i switched apps now i have to type it again fuck. Why am i such a lazy peice of shit? every time i try to focus on my problems i forget them and watch some youtube cuz i gave adhd idk and idgaf.. wowww now im making excuses for me being a lazy waste of human life. im such a fucking hypocritical whiney peice of shit. i just told myself to shut the fuck up 100 times in the mirror. and now i sound like im victimizing myself... im too self aware thats why every time i cut myself i think im doing it for attention. im fucking done. i say i believe in god and then i dont listen to a single thing he tells me to do and act like he doesnt exist. i cant own up to it. because im a weak fuck. honestly i cant do anything i put my mind to anything i want because of how much of a fucking weak hypocritical loser i am. and dont say i shouldnt think that im a terrible person because i fucking am and if i dont own up to it then i will never grow up. im not gonna ignore the fact that im a weak peice of shit. no one understands me. my dads a peice of shit to my mom. my moms a peice of shit to my dad. i cant do this shit any more. i have to grow some balls and meet my maker. #Suicidal_intention
I fucked up and i am bad at life and wish someone would make whats happening to me a situation that will just dissapear.I was depressed already and dont know how I can deal with this now.It feels like i dont have any excape and im seriously thinking of what to do and if this is the end.#Suicidal_intention
I'm too depressed to write a long suicide note. I missed out on my teen years I never been asked out to prom nor have I been to any HS parties. (I'm going into my senior year this august) i'm almost an adult and haven't accomplished anything whats o ever. I'm also fucking terrible at driving, I can't parallel park for the life of me. Recently lost my job so there's that. Life can't get any worse than this.#Suicidal_intention
It's been four years since we split up. I think about you every day and every hour. There are days in which not a minute goes by without thinking about you. At first, I was so angry that it felt as if the world was to fall apart. Then it felt like you died in front of my eyes. I often want to tell you how my day was, but you are with someone else now. I've been replaced, repackaged and thrown away. Now, I am not angry and not even sad anymore. I feel empty. Nothing can replace you and when I get home, you're not there. Not a single hug. I cannot recall the odor of your parfum anymore, I cannot remember the spark in your eyes. The spark was long gone when we were still together. You bought a house with someone else. I know you still deeply care about me, but I don't buy anything with it. It feels like the only way I can be forever in your mind, is to kill myself. I cannot do to my family and friends what my heart tells me to do, and here I am. Stuck. I don't live anymore, the day starts and ends. I am either in pain or totally numb, and it feels like I died the day you left me. Silke, I love you more than I hate myself.#Suicidal_intention
I've had the tools to do everything I needed to do in life, (that I didn't because I was too weak) available to me. Now that I'm faced with the exact resources I need to commit suicide, I'm too weak to do even that. I'm stuck in a place worse than death where I'm too hopeless to live, and too cowardly to die. My story isn't interesting, I'm sure many people would have been able to do great in my shoes, but I ruined everything ages ago. I have no talents, I have no friends, my family has given up on me, my day consists of watching anime and listening to music until 5 AM then sleeping until 3.#Suicidal_intention
I'm stuck in my parents' house because of quarantine, and I just realize that there's a rope in their store room and I can hang myself up anytime, especially at night because they are all asleep. I've been itching to do it since forever but I have no access to anything back then.#Suicidal_intention
"Realizing that I no longer really care how much my death would fuck people up. I'm just tired of living. Tired of holding up my end of the bargain and being met with nothing in return. This world is shit. Why should I keep living to make other people happy. I'm certainly not living to make myself happy. As far as I'm concerned that's not even possible. I'm pretty chicken shit so I'm not ready to kill myself yet but for the first time I no longer really care if anyone is hurt by my leaving. Honestly I find it quite selfish of people to expect me to continue suffering so they don't have to confront their fear of death. Everybody has to die some day. It's not like it matters. There no greater purpose. You can make your own but it will only ever be real in your own delusions of grandeur. Man's greatest hubris is thinking that they can create purpose. No one's legend is eternal. The sands of time wipe the slate clean eventually. Why stand defiant against them, so we can feign valor for or ""rightous"" fight while we sit on our deathbeds succumbing to the eventual grip of times deathly embrace. For my part I think what would be truly noble is to accept reality and go willingly into the great abyss without fear. IDK, my philosophy is dark and shitty and likely doesn't stand up to scrutiny. This turned into a rant rather suddenly. If I don't stop now I never will."#Suicidal_intention
life just keeps throwing bullshit after bullshit at me and i'm so done trying to keep up. no one cares. i can't really explain it but even around family 24/7 i feel so alone. no one really knows me, even though i've tried so much. everyone either leaves or doesn't care enough. i'm done seeking help, nobody cares until you're gone. i just wish someone would walk up to me, hold me, tell me they care and they'll be here for me. but no one will because everyone else is so self absorbed. i spend hours caring about other people, listening to their problems, but as soon as i need help everyone's gone. so many other people deserve such a great life and i wish i could give them all a piece of mine and just fade away. fuck this place#Suicidal_intention
 I can't take it anymore. This entire year has been a shitshow. My business partner fucked me over before COVID was relevant, the pandemic has canceled my senior year of High School, and now I'm falling for a co-worker who I just know that I have no chance with (hell, I think she already rejected me by rejecting my follow request.). I'm an ugly and useless piece of shit who deserves to be publicly shamed, humiliated, and executed. I plan on ending it all in the near future. I'm sick of being here when everyone I come across ends up hating me. I serve no purpose in this world other than to be God's punching bag and someone who is fun to reject for no reason. There is always something going wrong in my life. I wish to be at peace and killing myself is the only way.#Suicidal_intention
I am a Christian k cool we will start with that. I was abused by my father when I was 9 years old and verbally abused until 17. My father finally left when I was 17 making my mom a very very dedicated psycho catholic. The conflict that I've had with her because of that means I have no family relationships anymore - furthermore both Catholic families on both father and mother side think I should go to hell since I'm Christian not catholic. I've been depressed since I was 10. I was bullied my whole life. Over the summer leading into my 8th grade year my best friend raped me. I was suicidal 8th-12th grade. I had no friends and I had severe trust issues in everyone. I finally found people who helped me, and got me off the suicide train. By the time they helped me I attempted suicide at least a dozen times and contemplated it every single day. At the time I was an atheist. Those people helped me find God and life was good for a bit. Now those same people do things they know trigger ptsd from my past. They would talk about rape in front of me to trigger me. They would say I'm talking to them for attention despite me trying to make it very abundantly clear that I was trying to find a reason to live. They do things intentionally to make me depressed or suicidal so they have entertainment during this shit show of COVID. Every-time I asked them to stop they apologized to just do it over and over again. I developed a Stockholm syndrome effect with this group because they used to be so good for me, so I allowed myself to keep crawling back to be abused over and over again. They made me go from loving God to hating God so much that I wish I was an atheist again. I wouldn't even call myself a Christian anymore that's how much I hate God, the only reason I still believe is the logical argument behind it. With no family, no friends, no religion, no anything please tell me why I should be alive? It would be so much easier to just die and either be dead or go to heaven. What's the point in living if you legitimately have no reason to want to live. The typical response on these threads is â€œyour X will still care about youâ€ but I don't have that. I have no one, literally no one everyone in my family tree that's alive thinks I'm going to hell for renouncing Catholicism. I don't have any friends to turn to now when I'm depressed and suicidal. There's only one person I can think of that would care if I did off myself, but he would only care because he would have to live with the emotional burden knowing that I killed myself specifically because of him and what he's done.#Suicidal_intention
i have one friend and he is in the same mind set as me. he just got out of a super toxic relationship with my ex-best friend and now ive been branded as the school slut even though im only 13. every single one of the girls in my small school of about 70 people hate me and think i stole this girls BF (my friend) and all the boys either think that i want to fuck them or that i want to fuck their friends. i have tried for almost a year to leave this behind me but it just keeps getting worse and worse. my guy friend still loves his ex so i cant say anything to him about her. i know that if i kill myself he might have a chance with her again cause even if he says its not my fault she dumped him i know it really is and if i leave it will just fix the problem. but i also know that if i do then he might kill himself because right now were the only things keeping each other alive and it gets harder and harder each day to protect him. i don't know what to do, i'm becoming more and more numb to what people say and do and i don't know how to stop it. i wont tell anyone in person but i'm scared, im scared im losing myself and i'm going to reach a point where i cant come back.#Suicidal_intention
18 male and recently broke up with my girlfriend, we were dating for almost 2 years. Too some it might seem crazy how I can feel this way, but I really dont know what to do anymore. It was going well before a couple of days,when she said she was lying about loving me like I did her. She said that she can't be with someone like me anymore, she said the she wants to be the others as well. Well I do sure understand that to some degree, I was shooked that she did not tell me earlier. I do not wanna do anything anymore, Im feeling suicidal and hopeless of anything, I cant forget all the times we had fun and had an amazing time,and now its nothing anymore. Does anyone have any advice how to stray away from these feelings and thoughts?#Suicidal_intention
ive written a really nice suicide note and now i want to do it more. its very pretty sounding, and has quotes and things. im lowkey proud of it. ill probably be gone soon so my parents can read it and finally realize how much pain im in.#Suicidal_intention
Give me a reason, I don't care if it's selfish of me and others suffer, I don't want to live at all. Give me a reason to stay alive#Suicidal_intention
I don't enjoy video games anymore. I don't enjoy movies and netflix anymore. I don't enjoy anime anymore. I don't enjoy le funny quirky memes anymore. I don't enjoy junk food anymore. I don't enjoy porn anymore. I don't enjoy this website anymore. I want to be fulfilled but I'm afraid I'll never be. All I do is rot away in my bed alone. Like a dog who knows their time is coming so they go to a quiet and isolated place to die.#Suicidal_intention
Have you ever noticed it? Like something is pressing your lungs, so they can't expand. And when you are trying to do a deep breath, you instantly exhale it back. Like your body intentionally tries to prevent you from breathing. But why it still feels that you need to breathe? Why you can't just stop, if you clearly want to? Why it needs to be so hard and painful? Why you can't just close your eyes and stop breathing, so you will peacefully go to sleep?#Suicidal_intention
I'm coming to Reddit as I don't know who else to talk to. Without going into too much detail, I forced a sexual act on my partner while she was asleep and drunk. I didn't see it that way at the time, but the cold sober truth has hit me like a bullet - I raped the person I love most in this world. She has experienced rape in the past, which only makes it more confusing why I did what I did. Why did I not recognise what I was doing? How could I let myself do that to her? I have no answer for these questions and the pain in her eyes has broken me. She hasn't left me (yet) but I have left to house for a few days with our children to visit family and give her space (her request). The more time that passes the more the weight of my actions are pressing down on me. I have made it my only goal in life for almost 10 years, to keep her safe and make her happy. In one moment I've then gone and broken every value I hold dear and shattered my own perception of who I am. She says she knows I never meant to do anything to hurt her and that she knows I am a good person with a kind heart. But how can that be true? I want more than anything for her to be ok, she has had such a long road to overcome her past traumas. She deserves better than me. My children deserve to have a father they can look up to. I can't bear to see them look at me with total adoration knowing what I have done to their mother. When we arrived at my Mothers last night I tried to hang myself with a belt in the bathroom. But I couldn't do it. I don't know if I want to die but I know I can't live knowing what I've done. There is no way to fix it, nothing I can do to make it right. And the love and adoration of those closest to me feels like a mockery in my heart. She would be better if without me, but if I do kill myself I know that she would blame herself. And what damage would that do to my children...my world. But I just can't live with the guilt and pain. I don't know who I am, how I could do that. I wish I could just close my eyes and never wake up. I wish I never existed at all. But this isn't a dream and my world is falling to pieces before my eyes. I deserve to die, but that would be selfish. I should carry the pain so that others don't have to, but I don't know if I can. Cutting myself doesn't wash away my guilt no matter how much I bleed. I am on the edge of a knife and I don't know which way I will fall. I just wish it would all go away!#Suicidal_intention
I have a loving family and good friends. In the past, I told them about my suicidal and depressive thoughts and for the most part, they have been very supportive. I have drastically improved my grades in school and I am about to graduate community college and transfer to a 4 year school. However, the desire to kill my self still lingers in my mind. It just feels like I'm going to throw myself off a bridge regardless of all the good things happening in my life. I feel like such a burden to everything and everyone and I really think that I'm better off dead.#Suicidal_intention
I want to kill myself because everything seems to go wrong. Everyone has an easier life than me, and everywhere I go, I'm being treated like garbage by other women. There is no job that I want to do, which would bring me joy. I just want to die because then, I wouldn't have to worry about this. I live alone with my mother, and she has been abusing me consistently. My family talks shit about me or don't reach out to me at all ever since I was a kid. My father is rich, but he never gave me a cent, and I haven't seen him in 10 years. I don't have many friends left, and those who are left, they are not my real friends or have their own life. Every job I start, I'm being abused. I'd like to go to university, but I have no money, and I want to earn money, a lot of money. My mother works in a bad place, and she has her own issues with our family and at work. I don't know anymore. My last hope is to sell my body, as sad as it sounds. But then, I don't even want to do that. I just feel horrible. I had a bad experience with drugs months ago, and ever since then, my mind seems to go crazy, like I'm bordering on psychosis and not trying to slip from reality. Yesterday night, I couldn't fall asleep and had a paranoia attack, similar to when I was tripping.#Suicidal_intention
"I'm turning 22 next week - i'm spending July 4th alone today and I've cried a lot today. My suicidal thoughts started when I was 12, and I get to the point sometimes now where I'm like, really? They're still happening? I get really frustrated with myself because I try to do everything ""right"" and the ""healthy way"". I try exercising. I try eating well. I have a boyfriend I've known since High school. I have friends and a sister who I care about deeply. I am a straight A student in college hoping to go into the psychology field. And yet, this whole time, almost on a near daily basis, I just wish I was dead. It is not obvious on the outside - people think i'm a funny and happy person. I make people laugh and I present myself in a positive way when I'm out. But inside, it just fucking hurts all the time. In high school, I called the suicide hotline twice and never told anyone. It helped at the time, the woman stayed on the phone with me for an hour before announcing that she had to go. Therapy has been helpful too, but from my experience, I haven't found a foolproof ""cure"" to not wanting to hurt myself.  I self harmed for years and never told anyone about that either, and even five years later when I no longer hurt myself, the desire to want to die is still there. I am doing things ""right"", but it doesn't seem to matter. "#Suicidal_intention
It's the logical option. I'd rather be dead than spend 90% of my day daydreaming or sleeping. Everything i want to achieve seems impossible, and even if it id possible, it won't matter anyway. Atleast death is actually something interesting. Don't give me any advice. I don't want to hear it. I'm just saying whats on my mind.#Suicidal_intention
Listen, I've tried. Very hard. For years. It doesn't get better. If anything it gets worse and worse. The universe has decided to screw me over yet again. My sister is dead, my beloved little sister, the one that came to me every time she had problems. The one that I had to go visit in the hospital every few months every time she attempted to kill herself and now she's gone. And I'm fucking pregnant. Life can't possibly get any worse, but I'm not willing to stick around just to prove it. This will be my last message. I'm sorry mom that you had to suffer this much. I though I could stick around for you. But you will learn to live. You are strong. You are loved. I'll always be with you. Thank you everyone for the amazing support. This time is the last. Ignore this post and go respond to people who still have a chance. Tying my knot right now. Okay I'm inside. It's kinda hard but I think I did it right. If I did, goodbye.#Suicidal_intention
It has been a lifetime of mental illness. Treatment resistant. Meds, therapy, the lot. Add autism, add being trans, add being poor and jobless. and not having the language to talk about what I'm going through, I cannot keep going. I have spent months with only my husband's happiness keeping me here. I can't continue to only live for someone else's happiness. He isn't happy. I am a husk. I am a burden. I have drunk myself to hell and relapsed into self harm and I am not able to keep going. I simply don't have any other options. I just can't continue to be this empty shell. I'm very sorry.#Suicidal_intention
I'm finally accepting that the best thing for me to do is just die. I won't have to deal with anything anymore and everyone can just forget I ever excited and it's a win win for everybody.#Suicidal_intention
I've been fighting a war that I can't win. Depression, suicide attempts, alcoholism, and compulsive gambling. I took a really hard look in the mirror and realized my time here is coming in an end. No one can talk me out of it this time. My first attempt was a little over two years ago (thanks to my partner at the time screaming â€œfucking kill yourselfâ€) and I'm so tired of the pain and loss. The pain of having a long term partner cheat. The pain of my best friend overdosing. The pain of losing all trust in myself. I can't go without a day about thinking about dying. Once I made the plans and wrote out what I need to do before I go (write letters, clean, make amendments, etc.) I finally felt peace. There's a tremendous amount of happiness surrounding the idea that I won't be here much longer. Happy tears. It's a permanent solution to a permanent problem. The addict inside me needs to be stopped. The suicide hotline hung up on me. My regular therapist that I've been seeing for two years is quitting his practice. My dreams have been crushed. I'm in debt. This is the final chapter- I'm done. I've fought too long and it's time to give up. I don't want to be 25 and already have more relapses than I can count. I'm done failing. I'm done disappointing others. I'm done causing conflicts that could be easily avoidable if I was simply not me. I love everything and everyone, but I truly hate what's in the mirror. My mind is constantly persuaded by guilt and hate. The things I do are singular, detached from anything and everyone. There's no origin. No one's fault but my own. Remember that. And with this said, I say goodbye. It's a sweet goodbye like a sunset after a long day at the beach. It needs to happen- innately natural, at least to me. I am at peace and I see happiness on the horizon. I am going to feel the love that I've always wanted.#Suicidal_intention
I attempted suicide and now stuck on bed cause my leg fractured. I didnt feel grateful surviving it cause the after math is painful. Can someone help me please?#Suicidal_intention
I'm going to be home alone today, and part of me - actually most of me - knows that it's a terrible idea because I have many methods of ending myself in this house, and I'm the only one who knows that. But I try to think of the things I have that can stop me from doing it. Then I remember that the things I have are so far out of my reach or so far away for me to contact, that I can't. In the common sense of the term, I'm alone in my own space with awful, intrusive thoughts and access to many lethal weapons. A chemical. A knife. A substitute of a rope. Bedsheets. Bathtub. Banister. I've stopped taking my meds and I'm tired of waiting for death. I'm sick and I know it. My physicality is getting worse. My mentality is declining to its lowest brink. My last resort is to tell someone who lives close enough to save me, but nobody that cares about me lives close enough. To die, alone, freezing because of the air conditioner, in pain, depressed, and feeling as if I deserved it. It's fine. I'm okay with this, now. I deserve it, so it's okay. I've done horrible, irredeemable things. I am unfit for dating or love, everyone I love ends up afraid of me. I'm unfit for friends, I've lost so many because of my broken mental health. My stress has hit its very peak. The stress of thinking of all of the people I've hurt because of my actions. The people I would still have to this day if I could have simply gotten the help that I needed. I won't say that I am sorry, for I've said it too much for it to do anything for me or anyone else I've hurt. Such a numbing phrase. I'm sorry. I'm not. If I really were, then I wouldn't hurt people as easily as I do. But I do, and now where has that gotten me. I'm tired of living, and I want this to be the end of me.#Suicidal_intention
I decided im not gonna kill myself. but im gonna feel all this pain in life so i'm more prepared for when i burn in hell. Thats what life is. hell. Lmao why tf was I religious, thats the dumbest thing i've done in my whole life. What a joke life. I so badly want to kill myself though. All the damn time i'm wanting to just fucking off myself in horrible painful ways. Its such a strong damn urge, so i do wonder how long i will really last. I hope hell is real.#Suicidal_intention
This is my second post on this sub. I keep trying to be a better boyfriend but even though my girlfriend tells me I am a great boyfriend I feel like a waste of space. I have my next therapy appointment in 4 weeks but I don't know how I'm gonna make it that long. I hate everything about myself. So if I can't even love myself why should anyone else. I despise waking up in the morning just so I have to look at myself in the mirror and be reminded of the waste of oxygen that lies before me. I just want a break from life and the longest break I can think of is death. I want to feel something anything.#Suicidal_intention
paramedics are gonna have a laugh at that when they find my dead body next week#Suicidal_intention
Please can someone have some sort of answer for me. I have tried again and again to end my life but for some reason I'm so fucking bad at it. I don't understand why it won't work. Is it my unconscious self stopping myself because me consciously right now wants to be dead? I have genuinely tried. Genuinely. Like really genuinely. Wrote the note, cried my fucking eyes out and tried to do it. I've tried to cut my wrists but I couldn't get it deep enough or in the right place. I've tried to to strangle myself again and again. I've even tried to hang myself but it just won't work. Why? I am so tired. Both physically and mentally. Good people die every day. People who want to live life and have dreams and here I am. Who wants to die but can't seem to die. I want to end my life. So why won't it work?#Suicidal_intention
Iv been depressed for many years on and off. Past few months it wont leave, i have lost my partner in the most brutal way, lost my family my kids and everything i have. I am a shell of my former self. I have come to the realisation that i will never be happy. I will never have the family and the love i have always craved. I keep questioning why others have people who love them and stay together for life while i get brutally fucked over by the people i love the most. I cant take it anymore. I am alone, and will be alone forever.  My friends are not really that close, my parents have never liked me or made effort and the woman i loved for so long and gave everything i had to wouldnt care if i lived or died (she actually said this). I find no joy or happiness in anything any more. I dont feel any love or kindness from anyone. This world has chewed me up and spat me out more than once. I have been knocked time an time again. I kept getting back up like they tell you too but not this time. Im circling the drain of death, if i didnt have 3 children who would be hurt by my passing i would of already gone. Last ditch attempt of counseling and medication. Im thinking of setting a date. Say 6 months from now. I know time is a healer and i will feel better in time. However if things havnt drastically improved within 6 months i think its time.  Anyone else ever set a end state timer?#Suicidal_intention
I'm going to kill myself in less than an hour. I used to cry my eyes out at my misery. But now I feel nothing, because I know I'm going to die. It's almost like a sense of relief. I used to be so scared of upsetting my parents, but I don't even care anymore. Part of me feels like I should be remorseful, but there's nothing. I just wanna die. It's the only way out.#Suicidal_intention
I just don't think I can do this anymore. I'm sorry I've failed everyone. I just can't keep fighting anymore. I've lost. I'm such a horrible, horrible person. I just wanna end it so nobody will have to be cursed with my presence any longer. No matter what I do, I'll always be at death's door. I don't think I'll ever change. Because I am weak-minded and not courageous enough to get better. So I'll just do the next best thing. I'll end my life. Nobody cares about me anyway, they'll only care about me after I'm dead. So I'll give them what they want.#Suicidal_intention
I'm tired of the constant pain of feeling insecure about myself, my constant self doubt, about my appearance im tired of being ugly and not being attractive enough to date girls, (especially the ones I have major crushes I know are out of my league) and having no love or affection ever in my life from a has shot my self-esteem down majorly it has made me cry constantly it has made me think I'm not good enough or have the skill to get dates. I'm tired of not being good enough for others or apperciated. I'm tired of not having been anywhere or have done anything like have sex and stuff by my age. I just want my pain to stop. I'm tired of looking around me and seeing people in happy relationships in real life and especially online losing for pictures and shit happy as fuck.. tired of feeling so angry for being my self and why I am here and I hate having social anxiety around women I hate my life for the way I am. I don't want to really be here anymore I'm losing my drive to live because of it. When  have never experienced intimacy with a SO ever it really effects your mental state to no end. I have just accepted I probably won't have a SO and maybe get married but oh well I and die alone well if that is the case then at least I can say I'm not relying on anybody in my life and I can be independent and proud because at least I know there aren't very many people that are independent 85-90% of them are already in relationships...smh I can't live in this agony anymore nobody understands it which just makes me even more mad..I'm just a shitty person and I'm not cool enough because I also don't have many friends that can care or do even care..if I were dead they would give a rats ass about it..maybe this is pity but it really hurts me..my life is worthless as fuck and it's only becoming closer to being pushed off the edge..I'M TIRED AND MISERABLE! #Suicidal_intention
I didn't think that was possible. I already had a suicide plan and was determined to go through with it. The last days of my life had a certain freedom to it, I wanted to live my life with my friend and savor these last moments. My birthday is coming up in a few days, turning 19. And yet, I can't see myself enjoying myself at all anymore. I can't listen to music anymore, which was really my only closure. I used to love prog and jazz and fusion and all these different talented artists. But now I can't even fathom how I'm supposed to even go through with my plans, which involve renting a place. My parents aren't good, they aren't bad either. But however they may be they don't deserve to see their child lying dead in his room. I just wonder if I'm gonna even have the will to kill myself anymore. that sounds good on paper, but I guess it's only a matter of time before I muster the last of my strength to talk to people and get shit done. This is no way to live, and it's no way to die either. I feel like I'm in purgatory. I don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to do about this.#Suicidal_intention
last night was horrible. i couldnt sleep. the only thing i thought about was suicide and even then i was very happy, just thinking about it. happier than normal people and i got this tingly sensation in my stomach. im fucking confused what is wrong with me??. I dont think ill be here much longer at this rate#Suicidal_intention
So much so that I have an unbelievable urge to mutilate myself bit by bit, especially my genitalia because I am repulsed by the idea of sexual reproduction. I don't like humans. I don't give a flying fuck how edgy that sounds because it's genuinely eating me up. I don't know if I want to die, free myself of this human body, or to just never have existed.#Suicidal_intention
This feeling of indifference towards everything in life is growing bigger and becoming more justifiable each day and I just don't want to do this anymore. I tried to end it all 3 years ago but it backfired and got me into loads of troubles with my family.. If only it worked.. I wish I had the courage to find a way to end it, no matter how brutal, just get it done with for good. I have been distant from my close friends for a couple of years now, they're busy with their lives and I'm busy with mine and I can't find anyone to vent to.#Suicidal_intention
My plan is to buy 2, connect them and then attach a tube to one. I'll put the tube into a plastic bag and tie the bag to my head. I heard that co2 is the only gas that makes you panic that you can't breathe. Helium just knocks you out. And then you just breathe till you die of no air.#Suicidal_intention
It was already looking friendly when the world started going to hell but with the fact my mom and I are gonna be evicted from our house at the end of the month. We have no money or time to pack up, find a place and move into a new place (especially with trying to find a temporary place for our birds to stay until we get settled) and ya know... We're in the middle of a damn pandemic and my mom is in the category of high risk for covid. Before anyone asks our landlord waited until our states restrictions on evictions was lifted (which was on the first) before hitting us with the eviction notice. After I went through the rapid wave if emotions, crying my eyes out and just laying in bed for several hours straight, my brain just emotionally shut down. For the last few years I've been just chugging along, clinging to hope that things will at least stay stable and I could focus on my goals of being an artist. But now I feel nothing. I spent time with bf and I just faked a smile to seem fine but I just couldn't bring myself to find happiness which I know isn't fair to him. Mom and I have been through a lot of shit and have scrapped by by the skin of our teeth but I just don't see how we can possibly pull through this. I've been contemplating swallowing all of my pills, taking enough meletonin to put myself to sleep and hope I just go in my sleep. I know the chances of success are slim but better then my other plan which is stop drinking and eating or to just yeet myself off the overpass. Am I selfish and a coward for wanting to die, yes but I'm just tired of fighting against the world only to get pushed down and spit on. I know mom will be devastated as will my friends and other loved ones (mom especially since my older sister passed away a couple years ago) but hopefully they'll understand that I'm weak and just can't keep going anymore just to be a burden on them.  I know some are going to see this as a me wanting to be convinced to live but honestly I mostly wrote this for catharsis (if that's the right word) and to hold myself accountable if I chicken out. Thanks for reading.#Suicidal_intention
